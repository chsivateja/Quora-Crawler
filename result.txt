Even for ones that I haven\'t visited, the Chinese Exclusion Act from 1880-1943 created a large generational gap between present day Chinese-Americans. Since there was almost a 60-year gap between the two major waves of Chinese immigration, some Chinatowns (New York) which are comprised of early Chinese Immigrants from Northern China tend to speak Mandarin as their primary dialect and through the generations, will likely have picked up English as a fluent second language. The Post-Exclusion Act Chinese immigrants tend to have immigrated from Southern China - fleeing political turmoil of the cultural revolution - and are mostly Cantonese speakers. Since post-exclusion act Chinese immigrants are only in their 1st and 2nd generations in the US, this wave of Chinese-Americans are less likely to speak English fluently.The varying immigration times and causes have led to a few subtleties between Chinatowns across the US. I make the note about the generational gap because depending on which Chinatown you go to, you\'ll either be fine ordering with English..or you may end up with an interesting plate :-)---Anyway, of the three Chinatown\'s I\'ve been to:Oakland: The most functional of Chinatowns. Oakland\'s Chinatown attracts little tourism and is a six block collective of high rise apartment buildings comprised of ethnic Chinese residents, grocery markets, small shops, regional banks, restaurants and schools.Since Oakland\'s Chinatown has almost no tourist appeal whatsoever, it has the cheapest and best tasting Chinese food. By best Chinese food, I\'m speaking from the perspective of someone who never orders "Orange Chicken" and despises Panda Express. You\'ll be hard pressed to find pagodas and dragons on every street corner in Oakland\'s chinatownCantonese is the predominant dialect spoken in Oakland Chinatown. I\'d venture to 99:1 on Cantonese:Mandarin.San Francisco: One of the largest, most visited, and touristy Chinatowns. Due to SF\'s massive worldwide appeal, Chinatown is a popular stop for tourists. There\'s a number of buildings and structures that are built with the stereotype Chinatown feel (pagoda like, green/yellow/red paints, lots of dragons and pillars). The food is also good in San Francisco, but of lesser quality and more expensive than Oakland.Most of San Francisco\'s long time Chinese population actually live around Inner Richmond and the Sunset which has a more Oakland Chinatown feel if you ever walk around clement and 8th.Cantonese is the predominant dialect as well, but you can still find Mandarin (Northern Chinese) and Taiwanese speakers as well. Cantonese to Mandarin is probably about 9:1New York: I\'ve only visited NY twice, and from limited experience, New York\'s Chinatowns are more touristy and the food is of less quality than the west coast.Mandarin is the most common Chinese language in NY Chinatown. While I couldn\'t find any statistics, from only my experience, I\'ve encountered more 3rd+ generation (descendants of the first wave of Chinese immigration) Chinese-Americans in New York than I have on the west coast.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 8, 'answer_user': 'William Wai Wong'}, {'answer': 'One thing many might not know about NYC - it actually has 2 "Chinatowns".\xc2\xa0 There is Chinatown in Manhattan, but another in Flushing Queens, which is even larger and more vibrant.\xc2\xa0 In addition, there are pockets of other minor NYC Chinatowns in Sunset Park Brooklyn and Elmhurst Queens.All other "Chinatowns" on the East Coast are very tame in comparison - that is Boston, D.C, etc.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Andy Lemke'}, {'answer': 'A list of US Cities and areas with Chinatowns and/or Chinese populations:California: San FranciscoOaklandSan JoseSeattlePortlandLos AngelesSan DiegoMontereySacramentoStocktonMarysvilleLockeMonterey Park (San Gabriel Valley)New York City (Brooklyn, Flushing, Manhattan)PhiladelphiaBostonWashington D.C.ChicagoSt. LouisBooks: Fortune Cookie Chronicles by Jennifer 8.

Perhaps in your town every attic was a secret brothel or speakeasy, George Washington slept there, or there\'s a ghost of a little girl.A Chinese-American friend of mine is fairly resigned to the myths, and refers to this one as the "burrowing Chinese" stereotype. We Jews play the cello all day long, the Native Americans are honoring their spirit ancestors, and the Chinese are busy digging.Although there aren\'t a lot of secret tunnels around, and probably never have been too many, there are plenty of cool underground things.Not tunnels per se but there were a lot of speakeasies during prohibition, many were underground, and many have been revived in their original location.Many or most old buildings have basement storage rooms that extend under the sidewalk in front of the building, sometimes under the street. These are often connected so they make a tunnel-ish passage.The city used to be full of brothels, still is. Many are historic, some underground.The Old Ship Saloon had a basement and a trap door, something about drugging sailors and selling them to merchant ships. It used to be in an old ship. There are a lot of old ships buried under downtown, they weren\'t so picky about landfill back before the great earthquake, they just piled a bunch of rubble and dirt on top.There are dozens of water cisterns under intersections, built for safety after the 1906 earthquake, and you can recognize their circular brick outlines.The entire Embarcadero and its wide sidewalk is built over what used to be a beach and bay, some of it is still over water if you go to the edge and peer over.Lots of more pedestrian types of tunnels for trains, storm drainage, creeks, water, sewer, utilities, and underground electrical transformers (these explode sometimes, thanks to a rather inept utility company)FWIW a number of neighborhoods were built on old burial grounds or later cemeteries, and the bodies weren\'t always removed.

Throw in decades of tong wars, and it was like taking a stroll through San Quentin or pre-tourism Alcatraz. They likely would have remained hidden longer if not for the 1906 Great Earthquake and Fire. Among other acts of devastation, the fire obliterated Chinatown and uncovered its many deep dwelling places. Today, 96 years after the quake, they are the stuff of legend, their history living on in books, newspaper accounts and oral histories, much of which describe a subterranean world right out of your worst nightmare. "When the high winds blew the ashes away the yawning mouths of tunnels, which the police had long suspected, were revealed," wrote James Russel Wilson in his 1906 book "San Francisco\'s Horror ofEarthquake and Fire." "Entrance to these passages was so carefully hidden that only the leaders of the tongs, who used the damp dungeons for places of meeting or to plot the death of a victim -- the same room often acting as the execution dungeon once the marked man was taken below the level of the street -- knew and declared," he wrote. Despite a wealth of written evidence, many in the Chinese-American community challenge the existence of a complete tunnel network. "A lot of the crime stories of that era were associated with hideouts and tunnels and ways to get in and out," said California Insurance Commissioner Henry Lo, a longtime resident and former judge. "People tripped and fell into holes and described them as tunnels, but any kind of network for sinister purposes was pretty much fiction," he said. Lo is supported by many historians and a first-hand account by Jesse Brown Cook, who served as sergeant of the Chinatown police force until 1906, when he was named the city\'s chief of police. In his memoirs of the area, he wrote: "Perhaps it will surprise you to know that there is no such thing as the underground in Chinatown. True, you could go from one cellar to another, but that is all. In order to deceive the people, the Chinese guides would take them in on Grant Avenue, between California and Sacramento Streets, going down into a cellar. From this they would go downstairs into the next cellar, and so on, sometimes going into six or seven. These basements, however, were all connected with the stores on Sacramento Street." But there are many who favor the urban legend and say that historical records point in their favor. At their longest, according to some, the tunnels stretched all the way through the tiny 16-block enclave and into North Beach. They hid thriving opium dens, torture chambers and Escape Routes that confounded denizens and police for decades. As with the one that still exists in New York\'s Chinatown, the supposed tunnels were unmarked or marked only by signs in Chinese, and connected tong-run gambling houses and theaters upstairs with opium dens and squalid, privately-run debtors prisons down below. Mostly based on drunken, exaggerated retellings from white San Franciscans, The Examiner and other local papers were filled with lurid accounts of gangs of ferocious yellow men leaping up from the tunnels to rape white women, then disappearing back inside. The reality was a lot sadder. One of the main factors in building the underground abodes in The City was to provide Chinese Americans with an escape from their oppressors, the frequently brutal police force. Mayor Eugene Schmitz and attorney Abe Ruef, the power behind the throne, were two of The City\'s most corrupt and racist political figures, and they used their power to try to scare Chinese out of their valuable downtown enclave. But if racist attacks were a fact of life, so were the tong wars, some of which were rekindled as gang wars in the 1970s. As more immigrants settled in The City\'s most densely inhabited square mile, tong wars became increasingly violent. "Hundreds of men went to their deaths each year in Chinatown without an inkling of the tragedies being known to the police," Wilson wrote. The author believed the dead were buried 100 feet deep. "Members of the tongs marked for death left friends behind, men who refused to complain to the local authorities, but who, instead sought revenge themselves in the same fiendish manner that death had been meted out to their fellow-members," he wrote. The darkness ended with the April 18 earthquake and fire. After the dust had cleared, Mayor Schmitz wanted Chinatown relocated to Hunters Point. But China\'s Empress Dowager, just before she died, made clear how much the United States\' largest Chinatown already meant to China and the so-called "Oriental Trade." The Empress Cixi ordered her deputy ambassador in Washington to ride to San Francisco to pressure city fathers into letting Chinatown rebuild, right where it was. Schmitz and other city fathers agreed, with one proviso: no more catacombs. With such a rich history, many San Franciscans prefer the storied fictional past to the more mundane basement theory. Modern tunnel aficionados, many of them teenagers in search of excitement, get their kicks by hanging out in sub-basements, getting drunk in musty storerooms, and breathing in the stench of unused or dried-up sewers. Whether entering Molinari\'s in North Beach, the House of Shields off Market Street, or in the many hidden basements of Chinatown itself, today\'s "tunnels" lead under the physical buildings. The trail inevitably dead-ends at a concrete retaining wall or sewer main, but that does not stop those with a sense of history. If nothing else, walking hunchbacked for miles in search of hidden horrors of the past sure gets the imagination going. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Old Chinatown\'s Deep, Dark Secrets - By Nick Driver Published in The San Francisco Examiner 4/18/2002Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Leon Kitain'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 17, 11, 4), 'tag': ['San Francisco', 'Chinatown (San Francisco neighborhood)', 'Tunnels'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

Also, keep in mind that the larger Chinese restaurants, especially those right off Grant that get a lot of non-Chinese tourists, are known for terrible labor practices and frequent turn-over in staff.\xc2\xa0 Good Chinese chefs either open their own restaurants (Jai Yun) or move around from job to job, looking for a better paying one along the way - and that can be in the burbs.Chinatowns continue to be the first points-of-entry for newly-arrived, impoverished, Asian immigrants.\xc2\xa0 However, the United States - particularly California - experienced a wave of wealthy Chinese after Hong Kong was reabsorbed by China, so in middle-class enclaves (like Daly City, Milbrae or Sunnyvale) you will find Chinese food with more middle-class tastes and wallets in mind.\xc2\xa0 However, is this food indicative of all Chinese food?\xc2\xa0 Considering that the majority of China\'s population are rural peasants or impoverished urban dwellers, no.\xc2\xa0 It is merely ONE kind of Chinese food.Traditional Chinese food is still served in San Francisco\'s Chinatown, but one needs a rudimentary knowledge of Chinese cuisine to know the difference between what one one restaurant is good for as opposed to another.\xc2\xa0 There are restaurants and businesses who specialize in offal, jook, claypot, noodles, dim sum, "dan tat", moon cakes and won ton soup.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot that serve up the sweet and sour pork, the egg foo young, and the honey walnut prawns with mayo.\xc2\xa0 So again, "best" is subjective.Even the American Chinese food has its place and uniqueness there, so there are probably some folks who believe a room full of white people eating rice plates constitutes "bad" Chinese food.\xc2\xa0 Yet, places like Hunan Homes and House of Nanking serve good food.\xc2\xa0 So, in summary, while it may seem like the best Chinese food in the Bay Area isn\'t in Chinatown, that assumption can be right or wrong depending on who is asking the question.*This is actually a Shanghainese, and now Taiwanese, delicacyEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Kevin Weaver'}, {'answer': "In many cities (NYC, LA, SF) the best Chinese food is not in the nominal Chinatown (would love to know if this is the same in other cities as well).\xc2\xa0 My hunch is that this has to do with migration patterns.\xc2\xa0 The original Chinese immigrants settled in what is now known as Chinatown, creating a bustling community.\xc2\xa0 But subsequent waves of immigrants found they needed to move into different areas either because the original was too expensive, croded or something, so they started moving either to outer parts of the city (the Richmond in SF, Flushing in NYC) or to suburbs (Monterey Park et al in LA, Daly City et al in SF) and these areas could hold more people, creating more demand for restaurants. Also, I have a feeling that these areas are wealthier, so they demand higher quality food.\xc2\xa0 Finally, non-chinese folks (aka tourists) kept going to Chinatown for the authentic experience, but they didn't know what was good Chinese food, so the restaurants in Chinatown could go downhill without losing much money.One thing that has happened in SF at least is that the quality of food is increasing in Chinatown (Z&Y, Shanghai Bund to name 2 restaurants), which I think is due to locals learning more about the varied Chinese cuisines and demanding more quality, thus allowing great, regional restaurants to survive in Chinatown.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 8, 'answer_user': 'Andy Katzman'}, {'answer': '"Chinatown" is not really the centre of ethnically Chinese residents in SF, nor the cultural centre of those of Chinese national origin.

If you go to the Wholesale Produce Market near Jack London Square at 5 am, you will see all the Chinatown market owners and/or their employees loading crates of produce into their vans & trucks. The only difference is the labor costs and the profit markup. A major chain supermarket has to pay unionized produce handlers $14 to $25 per hour plus overtime & benefits and still expect to turn a big profit for shareholders. The average pay those elderly immigrant women receive for doing the same work in a Chinatown market is usually below minimum wage with no overtime pay for working 9 to 12 hours a day/ 7 days a week. Some mom & pop Chinatown businesses are able to get away with paying less than the minimum wage because they have arrangements with their employees to pay them a portion of their salary in cash in return for reporting fewer hours than the hours actually worked. Many of these immigrants do not have the language skills to seek employment anywhere else, so they have to go along with it.\xc2\xa0 Chinatown grocery markets also face stiff competition from the all the other Chinatown markets selling the same produce on the same block so they are forced to operate at a substantially slimmer profit margin just to stay in business. Chinese people by nature, are notorious penny-pinchers when it comes to shopping for anything so if you are selling produce and you don't have the absolute lowest prices, you won't survive in Chinatown.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'John Tam'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 10, 1, 15, 25), 'tag': ['Chinatown (San Francisco neighborhood)', 'Food in San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Kate Karas'}

The most significant impact is probably the introduction of Chinese food - restaurant was one of the only businesses Chinese immigrants could do (besides laundry). These restaurants adjusted Chinese recipes to local tastes. Chow mien, for example, was never an authentic Chines dish (at least the way they were cooked in China was very different). After being Americanized, dishes like this ended up popular in America.Embed QuoteVia  Zhenfeng Liu.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Rony Gao'}, {'answer': "In a broader context, Chinatowns have existed in the American mindset as two things: 1. Dens of evil filled with prostitution, drugs, and unsavory characters2. A place to see the exotic, try Chinese food, find firecrackers, a family fun tourist trap.Both ideas exist as places for tourism for the dominant cultural lenses, the first idea culminating from the first Chines communities that built up since the Gold Rush days as most of these communities were built for men. Because of discriminatory laws that did not allow women to immigrate and Chinese men to intermarry (i.e. miscengation laws), this environment was ever more influenced by opium (already in trade by the British) and prostitution. Not all men in Chinatown were like this, the businessmen and those looking toward the future found other ways to start families here.As far as influence, stories in newspaper and fiction that go back to the 1820's illuminate the opium dens and carry onto the modern day in movies like Chinatown, Big Trouble in Little China, and even Rush Hour. In San Francisco, the 1906 earthquake brought with it destruction of the community that lived there. The City of San Francisco had already started plans to move this community to Hunter Point as it sat on prime property neighboring the Financial District. Chinatown leaders, under the vision of a man named Look Tin Eli, fashioned a proposal for Chinatown to stay there, by creating a new community that would be ornately and exotically Chinese. Something designed to bring tourists in and hold onto it's existing location. This worked. Also, because of all of the City Hall's records had been destroyed, Chinese men created new names for themselves and non-existant family members to allow women and children to immigrate, thereby skirting the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This influx of immigration created the Chinatown of the 1900's to 1960's, an Americanized version that is seen in movies like Flower Drum Song. It was in this time that things like Chop Suey was popularized. As a side note, Mahjong was adopted by Jewish ladies of the Lower East Side though I haven't read enough to pinpoint when that happened.Embed QuoteVia  Zhenfeng Liu.Suggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Leonard Shek'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 2, 27, 6, 29), 'tag': ['American (U.S.) Culture, Habits, and Behavior', 'Chinatown (San Francisco neighborhood)', 'This American Life', 'Chinese American Culture', 'Chinese Culture', 'China', 'The United States of America'], 'question_user': 'Zhenfeng Liu'}

Santa Clara County had already been ruled out at an earlier stage because they chose to focus on expressway expansion instead of rail transit (bear in mind that San Jose only had 95,000 people in 1950, compared to over ten times that today). The system was not designed to ever be integrated with Caltrain because they were trying to make it the most modern urban commuter rail transit system in the world at the time. BART uses completely different technology, including an electric third rail and a different track gauge and was originally designed to be automated. Caltrain uses traditional diesel locomotives on standard gauge tracks (like an Amtrak train) because it has simply evolved from the passenger line that has been in place there since the 1800s.

It\'s clear that in this context, it isn\'t being used in the sense of "Do I need to breathe" or even "Do I need to exercise" but rather, "Will I have a significantly diminished quality of life if I don\'t have a car?"To answer THAT question, I\'d have to say that keeping a car in the city improves your life but costs a decent, but not outrageous, amount of money. I would recommend keeping a car if you can afford it, and, to an extent, would trade off other things like apartment size and location to have a car. A car really lets you get around the city with a facility that public transportation does not offer. For example, yesterday my girlfriend and I popped over to the Mission from SOMA (10 minute drive), parked at the 21st and Valencia garage ($2), and picked up hot chocolate and Lucca\'s ravioli for dinner. That trip took about 25 minutes, and would have taken 90 minutes by MUNI which means it wouldn\'t have happened. I wouldn\'t have done it with Zipcar either, since it would have cost me $13.Having a car, I\'m much more likely to "pop over" or "swing by" things, catch a beignet at Brenda\'s on the way back from a friend\'s house in the Marina, go to Ton Kiang for dim sum instead of the place near my house, catch half an hour of a cool circus performance, etc. And while parking is challenging it\'s usually an under-5 minute job.San Francisco is not Manhattan and it is not Los Angeles. In Manhattan, owning a car is basically pointless -- traffic, parking, and costs will bankrupt you, and the public transit system is so outstandingly good that you\'ll never want a car. In Los Angeles, of course, car nonownership is a severe handicap. San Francisco is in between the two -- you don\'t need a car, but it will be a really nice thing to have.It costs me $200 a month for parking, $50 a month in insurance, and $150 a month in car operating costs (fuel + maintenance + depreciation). Taking out about the $150 a month I would spend on cab and MUNI fares (going to many fewer places than I do now), it costs me about $250 a month to keep a car in the city, but I\'d gladly trim $250 off my apartment costs than get rid of my car.Gotta go -- picking up my girlfriend in Bernal Heights!Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 13, 'answer_user': 'Marc Bodnick'}, {'answer': 'There is no need for a car if you are living in Mission and working in downtown.

I took Caltrain all the way to San Francisco and then walk the final 0.9 miles. The monthly pass was $179.Northbound, there are 6 bullets a morning from Palo Alto. They take 37 or 39 minutes. Then it takes me about 18 minutes to walk from the Caltrain station to Mission and 5th. So the total commute time (from Caltrain arriving to sitting at my desk) was 55 minutes to one hour.Leaving Caltrain, I walked down Townsend towards Fifth, then took Fifth the whole way. This is quicker than walking down Fourth, even though Fourth is nicer. (It's not legal to walk across the 80 onramp at 4th & Harrison - so if you walk Fourth for much of the way to Mission, you have to cross to the northeast side of Fourth - which is away from your final destination.) Comparing the alternatives:Caltrain + Muni:Public transit from Caltrain to 5th and Mission isn't quick or straightforward - Google Maps says the fastest Public Transit option from Caltrain to Fifth and Mission is taking the 47 from Caltrain to Fifth and Harrison - then walking the final 0.4 miles. ($2 for saving at most 7 minutes and a half mile of walking is below my value threshold. And that time savings is only if you nail the connection.) To minimize walking, they recommend either the 45 (16 total minutes, have to walk from 3rd and Mission to 5th and Mission) or the N (18 total minutes - literally no time savings). Heading to Caltrain, however, both the 30 and the 45 stop at Fifth and Howard and Fifth and Market and bring you right to Caltrain. According to Google Maps, that makes it about 9 minutes from Fifth and Mission to Caltrain.Caltrain + BART:Caltrain takes about 15 minutes, on a bullet, from Millbrae to the SF 4th & King Caltrain station. With walking, that's about 33-35 minutes from Millbrae to 5th and Mission. BART takes 29 minutes, plus then a few minutes of walking, from Millbrae to the Powell station (the closest BART station to 925 Mission).

One, noted by Mike Hamilton, is that they change the train to try and "balance" the service levels (even though it seems like the levels are still unbalanced). NextMuni thinks there will be an L but they change it to a J or whatever.Second is that the computer voice announcements are based solely on the ATCS software. That system thinks that a train at Powell going inbound will reach Embarcadero in 3 minutes and then turn around in 2 minutes to be outbound.\xc2\xa0 It does not take into account how slow other trains are going, whether the operator will take a bathroom break, etc. This is why it can say Outbound M in 5 minutes at Montgomery but it really takes 8 or more.The NextMuni system is used to feed those large monitors in each of the stations.\xc2\xa0 This is a separate GPS system which predicts travel times based on a combination of schedule, historical data and analysis of current conditions. It can be very accurate in typical situations, but GPS doesn\'t work in the subway so NextMuni has to "guess" more. Note at Embarcadero there are two displays. One shows the typical NextMuni with map and prediction times and the other shows the raw feed from the ATCS display. That raw map can be really helpful in figuring out congestion, problems, etc.Finally, some trains are stored at a yard along the T line and come into service. They will show as N or K until they get into the ATCS entrance near Folsom and then change to the actual letter.

Poor maintenance in the 20th century led to a further decline.\xc2\xa0 Balkanization of the regional transportation system prevented effective growth.SF has a very high population density of 17,200 persons/sq.mi and is only exceeded by NYC at 26,000 persons/sq.mi.\xc2\xa0 The geography and geology isn't easy, but it was over come with cable cars long ago and NYC's geology isn't completely trivial either.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where SF does have a disadvantage is that its population is low, only 800,000 and its work force has a large fraction of commuters (I couldn't find the exact number but I'd guess around 300,000 per day).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally there\xc2\xa0 is history.As has been pointed out, SF had a functional cable car system operating before the 1906 earthquake.\xc2\xa0 The system had more lines that what it has now.\xc2\xa0 SF had a population of 300,000 at the time\xc2\xa0 and was in the top 10 most populous US cities (SF has only grown 150% in the intervening century).\xc2\xa0 So there was plenty of motivation to build an effective public transportation system at the same time that NYC and Boston were building theirs.The 1906 earthquake destroyed the system and bickering\xc2\xa0 prevented it from being effectively rebuilt.\xc2\xa0 Even before the earthquake, the United Railroads of San Francisco had been trying to change the cable car system to overhead system and in the aftermath, the system became MUNI.\xc2\xa0 During the middle portion of the 20th century, MUNI and the remaining cable car system severely deteriorated due to a lack of maintenance and generally dysfunctional politics.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was during the time of car dominance and many US cities ripped up their street car lines.There were numerous political decisions taken in the intervening decades that weakened the public transportation systems.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Notably amongst these decisions was the creation of roughly 40 different regional transportation agencies, e.g. BART (1957) and CalTrain (1977).\xc2\xa0 Instead of creating a coherent system integrated with MUNI, these are stand-alone systems that do not connect smoothly with each other creating expensive, slow systems that motivate many people to drive into SF rather than take a public transportation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San...http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/hi...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 10, 'answer_user': 'Jay Wacker'}, {'answer': 'NY subway was built when safety concerns were minimal, and when human life was "cheap" - plenty of people died while building the NY subway.SF got started as a city much later, and the population density didn\'t warrant building a subway until after World War II, and by then it became exponentially more expensive to build anything for all the above-mentioned reasons, plus safety requirements have risen dramatically as well.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Toli Kuznets'}, {'answer': 'In terms of public transportation, you cannot compare New York to any other city in the US.\xc2\xa0 With 26,000 people per square mile, NYC is by far and away the densest city in the country.\xc2\xa0 Plus this density is spread out over a relatively large area, when you consider even Brooklyn, Queens, and Bronx are extremely dense for American urban districts.\xc2\xa0 THE most important variable for effective transportation is population densities.\xc2\xa0 This is why public transit works better in Boston than Atlanta, even though the Atlanta metro area is more populous.\xc2\xa0 San Fransisco itself is quite dense, but the density is not even half of that of NYC.\xc2\xa0 There certainly are other figures in the equation, but the simple answer to why NYC public transit is so good lies within population density.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Benjamin Ross'}, {'answer': "Started too late.

The goal of the report is to plan the future of housing, land use, transportation, environment, and the built environment in the San Francisco Bay Area. In order to encourage more environmentally & economically sustainable urban environments, the MTC identified in the map above - in purple - where future housing and mixed-used development should have high priority in the next 20-30 years.In other words, instead of driving far away from your house to work, why not live, work, and play, next to a transit hub?These are known as transit-oriented developments, which are medium to high density developments (residential, commercial, industrial, civic, green space, etc.). The second picture above actually is a transit oriented development being built of the Pleasant Hill BART Station in the East Bay.The goal is to minimize the (environmental/economic) cost of transportation for families and commuters, as well as reduce the need of suburban sprawl.In addition, the San Francisco Bay Area population is growing!As of 2011, the population is 7.15 million people. [2] Conflicting studies show that the population could go anywhere from 8.4 million to 9.5 million by 2040 [3]. Given the high cost of building highway infrastructure, as well as limited land space, transportation and city planners are focusing on ways to create more transit-friendly environments that is convenient for living, working, and playing.Given the high cost of living in the City & County of San Francisco, this sort of planning is actually beneficial for San Francisco; given SF\'s limited space, SF\'s neighbors in the East Bay can alleviate some of its housing pain.

The average local train had 294 people. Those trains tend to be the ones that run outside of rush hours, virtually none run during the highest peak times (the other train type is called "limited" and at 564 people on average is closer to "baby bullet" ridership.)The midnight Saturday is a very "average" train, with 303 people on board. That makes it less than half full.Because Caltrain stations are most self service, it\'s probably not the case that baby bullet trains are significantly cheaper to operate than local trains, but there would be some considerations with a nighttime baby bullet.By not stopping everywhere, it would only be useful to people who were willing to wind up at a few stations. That would limit ridership.The limited stops would make ticket checking easier and would likely keep compliance costs low.Unless you run one train in each direction, you have a problem. You\'d have to return the train to the opposite end in time for the next morning\'s run. There aren\'t a supply of extra trains such that you could keep on running a train south over and over every Friday and Saturday without also running a train north at some corresponding time (before Monday morning) to balance things out. This would add cost, unless that run was also profitable.It\'s pretty likely that most of those off-peak trains do not cover the operating cost of running them and that without the full rush-hour trains Caltrain would be perpetually in the red. How far in the red? Well that\'s where it gets harder to tell. Given that off-peak trains have lower fares and lower occupancy, they are probably running at a deficit of a couple thousand dollars per run, but precisely what those numbers are, I cannot say. My very crude guesstimate is that an extra baby bullet, southbound-only, on Friday and Saturday nights would cost Caltrain $500K per year.[1]Page on caltrain.comEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Mark Rogowsky'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 13, 18, 46), 'tag': ['San Francisco Public Transportation', 'Caltrain', 'Trains', 'San Francisco Bay Area'], 'question_user': "Adam D'Angelo"}

If you're heading north into San Francisco, I recommend just taking BART (it depends on where you're going, but there's few places I'd recommend transferring from BART to Caltrain to head to San Francisco).Before about 7pm on work weekdays, you need to take BART north from SFO to San Bruno, and then south from San Bruno to Millbrae.

First, San Francisco is indeed planning to increase the size of its underground transit system.San Francisco Municipal RailwayThe reason why it hasn't grown faster and farther is, indeed, density. It's extremely expensive to build a subway system, and it only makes sense if lots of people use it. The people who use it the most are the ones living close to the stations. The only way to have lots of people living close to a station is to have high buildings. However, San Francisco took the decision a long time ago to limit the height of its buildings. Less height, less density, less users, less tickets, less revenue for the subway, and less money to finance the expensive construction.Most other cities that have grown vertically (New York, most European and Asian capitals) have underground systems that are much more developed.The height limits in San Francisco are changing, especially in the SoMA area.

If you work in SoMa and live in the Mission, you can get away with a single speed or fixie since you don't need to go up hill. (Single speeds are very easy on maintenance, and don't get messed up badly on Caltrain.)Many people will want gears.

You'll find varying opinions on how awesome helmets are, but I like helmets. I recommend rain over-pants and a hooded rain-jacket for the rainy months. Clear glasses can be nice to keep rain from going in your eyes. Don't forget lights and reflectors. Bright lights cause drivers to respect you more and give more passing distance. Reflectors can be brighter than lights, depending on the light source, and when they're moving (either on wheels or ankles/pedals), they are impossible to mistake as a fixed object. (When a car is going 45 miles an hour, a fixed-height reflector can be mistaken at a distance for a fixed obstacle. Reflectors that move up and down are unmistakable and give increased safety.)I also highly recommend taking something like the SF Bike Coalition's Safety Classes. Lots of safety tips for cyclists are not obvious. When to take the road, what to watch out for, etc make a big difference in safety. The League of American Bicyclists organizes similar classes.

The Mission has amazing food (not just Mexican but do try a Mission Burrito while here), beautiful murals and lots of great small shops, stores and cafes. Hayes Valley is a small stretch of great unique stores and fantastic restaurants. South Park in SOMA is the heart of the SF tech community (and was the heart of the 1990\'s Internet bubble). The Ferry Building has great farmers markets on Tues, Thurs and Saturday as well as a 7 day a week fantastic collection of food stores and restaurants - and isn\'t just a tourist attraction local shop there every day as well.Other things to consider doing which do not require a car:- rent a bike and bike to and across the Golden Gate Bridge- take the ferry - to Sausalito would be my suggestion though other options would be to Angel Island or Alcatraz. Beautiful and inexpensive though you do have to pay attention to the schedule. - take the BART to the East Bay and go spend a day in Berkeley and/or explore neighborhoods of Oakland such as Rockridge or downtown and see a film at the classic Grand Lake theater.- take the Muni to the Castro, see a film at the amazing Castro theater, explore the heart of SF\'s gay community (though plenty of folks who are not gay such as myself spend a lot of time in the area as well) and enjoy the many great dining (and shopping and nightlife options). I\'m particularly fond of Zadin for dinner (full disclosure - the owners are high school friends of my girlfriend though I loved and recommended the restaurant before she and I were dating) - enjoy SF\'s amazing coffee culture - I\'ve posted elsewhere on Quora my long (and I do mean long) list of coffee options but basically DO NOT drink Pete\'s or Starbucks coffee while you are in SF, instead enjoy the amazing local cafes and roasters - Blue Bottle (especially their Mint St location which is among my favorite suggestions for breakfast downtown), Sightglass (on 7th & Folsom - a great option if your hotel is along 7th), Ritual in the Mission on Valencia, The Summit and Four Barrel also along Valencia (The Summit is also the home of I/O Ventures a new tech startup incubator). Coffee Bar in the Potrero neighborhood is fantastic and has great food - and the neighborhood is one few tourists see. Be flexible in the restaurants you dine in - avoid any national (or for that matter local) chains and instead make reservations at local restaurants or select a neighborhood such as Hayes Valley, The MIssion etc and just pick a place that has good reviews and availability for your group that evening - though if you have the time and patience I would suggest trying for places that might be a bit hard to get into (which in SF is usually a good thing). Flour + Water in the MIssion for example is amazing and though they take a few reservations each evening they also keep a number of tables which are available first come first served - i.e. you will want to get there before they open for dinner that evening and line up - well worth it. But classic SF restaurants such a Zuni Cafe are also well worth trying and perhaps slightly easier to get into (they serve both lunch and dinner - both are excellent)And a final suggestion - DO BUY a MUNI FASTPASS. Muni sells tourist "passports" which will give you unlimited rides for 1, 3 or 7 days. Buy one and use it - this makes it easier for you to just hop on and off the muni without worrying about transfer times or having enough exact change. You can buy these at SFO or at the Muni kiosk at Powell & Market (and I think the Muni stores in the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations, your hotel likely can also help you here).There are a lot of tourist attractions and places to go see (and restaurants concierges will likely suggest - such as Sears Fine Foods) For the most part I would suggest minimizing your time in those places. Coit Tower is fun to walk up, Union Square is worth a quick visit but for me the real attractions SF are in the neighborhoods - the Painted Ladies of Alamo Sq, the beauty of the waterfront and Ocean Beach etc. Golden Gate park is worth a visit, though personally I would skip the de Young Museum (the Academy of Sciences however I\'ve heard is very good).have fun, hope this was/is helpful.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Shannon John Clark'}, {'answer': "I have been 3 times to SF and only rented a car for 2 days the last time (which I used to head over to the Petaluma/Santa Rosa area and back).

Super Shuttle is a good service but you have to be pretty accurate when you talk with them - I've know people to take Super Shuttle for a morning flight only to arrive too late to board due to cutting things too closely. Very early in the morning you can occasionally luck out and be the only passenger for Super Shuttle. If your plans are highly flexible an option to consider might be to see about switching to a hotel very near the airport the evening before your flight - that might either offer you a free shuttle to the airport from the hotel or at a minimum a low cost cab ride to the airport (this is basically shifting your transportation challenge to the day before your flight leaves - but might be worth considering)Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Shannon John Clark'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 25, 3, 26), 'tag': ['San Francisco Transportation', 'San Francisco Public Transportation', 'San Francisco International Airport (SFO)', 'BART'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

This is a somewhat haphazard list of observations on personal experience public transportation here and in several other places I've visited. I have never taken public transportation to the San Francisco airport from Santa Clara. It does not run that early, or that late, and the trip would mean taking something (friend? taxi? bus? 2-mile walk?) to the Caltrain station, to Bart. Of course, if it's the airport, chances are I need to arrive at 5am, which wouldn't be much fun to increase by 2 hours, even if trains did run at those times.At a minimum, Caltrain could, and should, add some means to buy the Bart transfer to SFO, or simply include it for passengers getting off there. Better yet, Caltrain and Bart would connect at both ends and adopt a single, simplified ticketing system. Even if they remain under the direction of separate agencies, passengers could choose a destination (or buy an all-day pass), pay once, and let the agencies' computers sort out the final tallies. When that part is working smoothly, throw in the local buses that get people to their final destinations.Many people here don't take public transportation regularly. Any simplification that would help the occasional passenger (visitors from out of the area, people heading to an event in San Francisco, etc.) would probably have a positive impact on regular ridership, too.In all the places I've traveled outside the U.S., there was no need to have a car.Public transportation in Sweden, even the rural parts, is extremely well coordinated. I don't mean merely pretty timetables. I mean that buses and trains leave when they should (both on time and at times that are convenient). They also know coordinate about how different parts of the system time to one another. That is, if a train is going to arrive late for some reason, the bus driver on the connecting route will hear about this and wait for the train. One ticket (typically an RFID card for regular passengers, or a bar code would do) scans you into the system, with a scanner on the bus or train for all connections. They seem to be very concerned with both reliability and safety, and actively remove from service older vehicles and trains that no longer serve current standards.On the other end of the economic spectrum, La Paz, Bolivia runs on a system of minibuses (basically, largish vans with extra seating and little cargo space). They're operated by individuals or small companies, who get permits from the city to run a wide assortment of routes. They're inexpensive, and if you know which one to hop into, you can get from pretty much anywhere in or around the city to pretty much anywhere else. I don't expect any 20 Americans would gladly get quite that cozy, but they seem to be a good solution for La Paz, which has older, narrower streets, limited economic means, and lots of districts full of smaller side streets. One nice thing about many smaller vehicles like this is that they tend to get closer to both ends of any given journey.Somewhere in between, Buenos Aires, Argentina has an excellent, efficient subway system with connections to regional trains for elsewhere in the area and a system of full-sized buses run by colectivos. It's possible to get close to just about any part of the city in fairly short order on a subway ticket that costs about 35 U.S. cents.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Betsy Megas'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 10, 21, 0, 16), 'tag': ['San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Bruno, CA', 'Santa Clara County, CA', 'Santa Clara, CA', 'San Mateo, CA', 'San Francisco Public Transportation', 'Sunnyvale, CA', 'BART', 'Menlo Park, CA', 'Peninsula (Bay Area)', 'Public Transport', 'Caltrain', 'San Jose, CA', 'Mountain View, CA', 'Palo Alto, CA', 'Civil Engineering', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Alan Nguyen'}

First of all, many of the places will have free entrance if you RSVP online, typically requiring you to be there before 10:30-11pm. In general - check sfstation.com, and you can follow those places on twitter / facebook for their promos / free events if you dont mind the extra noise.Case in point - Temple (templesf.com) comes to mind, over at SOMA, nice house/dubstep parties and always fun hiphop downstairs. 2. All-around good fun in more dive-ish / mission-hipster-esque atmosphere, usually old school hiphop, 80ies hits and such - Beauty Bar at the Mission (Mission and 19th). Extra points for having Taqueria Cancun across the street. Kinda gets old fast I feel like, but you can get some mile-age out of it :)3. If you're more into mixed crowd (LGBT or just gay-friendly), you can try Qbar and Trigger around Castro / Market. Tuesdays are ladies night (read: lesbian), but if you're not acting all douchie you can just enjoy really great dance/pop mixes in a super cheerful, colorful atmosphere, always packed to the brim and great vibe.4. Madrone art bar - over around Divisadero and Fell (NOPA), hip art bar that has some great dj/live music. I especially like Tuesday nights, live funk/boogaloo band there - really great musicians, goes on until pretty late too. Usually no cover or very cheap one if at all.5. Matrix fillmore at the Marina - lounge/bar with decent music most of the time, check out their calendar for whats free or not. Marina crowd.6. Folsom & 11th St. area - DNA Lounge, Slim's, Holy Cow, WiSH - lots of places around there, mostly cheap covers or no cover at all, but really depends on day of the week / who's playing.

{'qid': 136, 'ans_num': 6, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85What's a good bar in SF for a bootstrapped startup to throw a launch party on the cheap?", 'answers': [{'answer': "Actually, more often than not, venues in San Francisco will give you the space for free if you can guarantee a minimum amount of people (the amount differs on the venue) or guarantee a minimum in liquor sales (the amount differs depending on the night as well as on the venue). In fact, this works even better if you throw a party on a traditionally slow night (ie \xe2\x80\x93 Sunday, Monday or Tuesday). I would definitely recommend not throwing a party any place where you have to pay for the space since you're bringing them liquor sales for the evening without them having to lift a finger. Keep in mind, party promoters get paid by venues to perform essentially the same function.The first thing to do if you're looking for specific venues is to figure out roughly how many people you expect to show up; that will determine the venue you should go with. If you're going for under 75 people that will change your options versus having a launch party with over 150 people. Here are some venues to look at (I put in venues of different sizes because I don't know what you're looking for):* Oz Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/oz-loung...) \xe2\x80\x93 They only serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They do not serve shots. Their capacity is about 60 people and they have excellent food if you want to class it up for cheap. This is more of a lounge vibe. If you ask them nicely, they'll even get a jazz band to play for your party for cheap. Or they can also bring in a DJ.* Sugar Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-ca...) \xe2\x80\x93 They have a full bar and will serve all kinds of liquor. They also have two different closed off areas for private parties, if you'd like. They also serve excellent food and if you get the whole place to yourself their capacity is about 150 (but I wouldn't go over 100 with them otherwise things can get uncomfortable at the bar). They don't have a license for live music, so they play music off an iPod (you can bring in your own if you want them to use that). This is also a lounge vibe.* The Cellar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cell...) \xe2\x80\x93 This is right next door to Sugar and it's more of a club vibe than a lounge vibe. They have two different rooms and their capacity can easily hit about 200 (comfortably). With their recent renovations it's gotten really classy, but the drinks are still really cheap. They have two rooms and they are often willing to give you the smaller room (~50 person capacity) if you just want that.* Mah-velous (http://sfluxe.com/2010/11/03/sim...) \xe2\x80\x93 These guys are so new they don't even have a Yelp page yet, but they are actively looking to get the word out about themselves. They're strictly a coffee and wine bar and their capacity is comfortably about 30; but it's a dope little venue. For a wine bar, their prices are pretty inexpensive. If you're looking for a smaller launch party, but classy (and relatively inexpensive), this could be an option.* Blur (http://www.yelp.com/biz/blur-san...) \xe2\x80\x93 This is a nice little bar on Polk Street. They have a full bar and their bartenders are really cool. They have a comfortable capacity of about 60, but it's a really cool spot.* Impala (http://www.yelp.com/biz/impala-s...) \xe2\x80\x93 While the Yelp reviews are mediocre, it's under new ownership as of December and the new guy is really working on making some serious changes. If you're going to throw a party there you can get the downstairs/VIP room to yourself and it comfortably fits about 100 people. They also have one of the best bartenders in the city (he's a trained mixologist). They serve some pretty solid Mexican food and they can make some stuff for your party as well.* The Parlor (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-parl...) \xe2\x80\x93 This place has been doing a good job of reaching out to tech companies in recent days, so I'd take a look at it. It's in Fisherman's Wharf, but don't let that stop you. They have three full bars in the venue and they can fit well over 300 people comfortably.Ok. I'm going to stop writing a book now.

The spaces are all very open and lounge-y feeling.Otis (http://venuetastic.com/venues/ot...)Otis also has two floors, with what feels like much smaller, more intimate spaces upstairs for private conversations.Rye (http://venuetastic.com/venues/ry...)Is partitioned and very airy - there are vague sections, but the layout is much more open than, say, Otis.An additional advantage to these spaces is that they\'ve both got tons of personality without much work on your part, so these are great options if you\'re looking for a unique space and an interesting feel.Embed QuoteVia  Jeremy Richardson.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 11, 'answer_user': 'Christine Yen'}, {'answer': '111 Minna is good. Gallery space with a stage for music, plenty of projector real estate, 2 bars, 2 rooms. B Restaurant and Bar in Yerba Buena is beautiful, they have a lot of neat packages, if you are looking to do branding they have a lot of capabilities with all glass walls. Not good if you want multiple rooms or projector though, but with a group that\'s only 150 you might want a place that feels a little cozier than getting too spread out. Box SF is literally just an "event space." It\'s beautiful, but is pricey, has a lot of build outs and customizations that need to take place. But it is targeted exactly for that business size.The best deal I\'ve found is House of Shields on New Montgomery just across from the Palace Hotel. Lots of character (think speakeasy style). Very accommodating. Excellent business to work with. And they\'ll do an open bar without liquor restrictions. They\'ll help you customize a branded menu. And they do their own catering of pretty delicious appetizers.

Have you considered hiring a Destination Management Company or Event Production Company? You may think that hiring someone to help you with planning and logistics will just add cost, but you'd be surprised how much a DMC can help you save money by getting the best quotes from reputable vendors (they have purchasing clout, because they hire them all the time) and they can use their experience to help you avoid costly mistakes. It's sort of like you might be able to replace the brakes on your car to save money, but only if you value your own time very little, because a professional mechanic can do it much faster and not break anything in the process.If you'd like to search for a DMC, check out:http://eventrfp.com/Destination/...(this will also give you a dashboard for sending RFPs and keeping track of responses) orhttp://www.adme.org/dmc/members....This is the directory for the big trade organization for DMCs.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'David Adams'}, {'answer': 'Renting a club like Mezzanine, Mighty or Temple is probably a good bet.

I think August Capital had a party there. Other grand historic rooms include the City Club (www.cityclubsf.com) and my favorite, the Julia Morgan Ballroom (julia morgan ballroom). The Marines Memorial has a beautiful room up top (please forgive their cheesy pictures www.marineclub.com/groups.php).Some other high places with views - you can rent out the Top of the Mark (www.intercontinentalmarkhopkins.com/top_of_the_mark/) or the Starlight Room (www.harrydenton.com/index.php?page=private). The most spectacular is probably the top floor ballroom at the St. Francis (skip the lower floor ballrooms) - www.westinstfrancis.com/weddings-social-events/.Terra Gallery (that's where the first SF Quora user party was last year). I'm only so-so on this one, as it takes a lot of work to decorate it nicelyYerba Buena Center for the Arts - Yelp had its Christmas party there once. http://www.ybca.org/rentals/venu....SF Moma, the convention room www.sfmoma.org/about/facility_rentals/facility_rentals_policies. Museums can be cool... you could do it at the California Academy and party under the dinosaurs, www.calacademy.org/visit/plan_an_event/.If you want to be extra classy, the St. Regis and the Intercontinental (the Convention Center one, not the Mark Hopkins) both do parties very well.\xc2\xa0 For a different vibe consider Clift Hotel. When you do it at a hotel you can rent a hospitality suite upstairs for an afterparty / private reception room kind of thing, and also rooms for any visiting investors, dignitaries, etc. Some hotels like the Westin or Four Seasons can do an outdoor tent, which is kind of fun.A number of nightclubs are in that size range: Infusion Lounge (http://infusionlounge.com/), Slide (http://slidesf.com/), Temple (www.templesf.com/), Mezzanine (www.mezzaninesf.com/private_events.asp), Slim's (www.slims-sf.com/fr-PrivateEvents.html), DNA Lounge (www.dnalounge.com/booking/)Ruby Skye - may be too big, http://www.rubyskye.com/index1.h...111 Minna is a classic.

This is my own ranking based on convenience for driving, parking, accessibility, nightlife and how the commute is.1) SOMA - The nice parts to live in are south of Harrison and between 2nd and 5th. Areas between 5th and 10th get a little sketchier with the amount of homeless shelters and dimly lit streets in the area. SOMA has easy access to 280 if you're driving. From most parts of SOMA, you can walk to the Caltrain station pretty easily. Parking is okay, but most condos have a place for you to rent a spot for $150-300/month. The Avalon apartment complexes are pretty much full of young professionals in their 20s. Not too much local nightlife other than 330 Ritch. But it's easy to catch a cab and get to any part of the city for $7-$15.2) Mission - Very lively; you can walk anywhere and everywhere and find bars and restaurants. Dolores Park on summer weekends is awesome and there are tons of bars and lounges around: 16th and Guerrero, Valencia, and Mission between 18th and 22nd. Stay away from the 16th/Mission and 24th/Mission Bart Stations. It's as the Brits would say, dodgy, at times. Also, there's known to be a few muggings and robberies targeting Google and Apple shuttle commuters. Parking here is okay, but I recommend parking west (or up the hill) of Valencia, the closer you get to Mission the greater likelihood your car will be broken-in to.3) Russian Hill/Nob Hill - Great area, very safe (more so Russian Hill). Tons of bars up and down Polk Street for a mile until you reach the Tenderloin/Civic Center. Parking is horrendous though and requires a city permit if you want to leave your car there during the day. I used to spend on average of 10-20 minutes to find parking and I would consider 5 blocks away as close. The drive to the freeway in the morning isn't bad -- just take either Polk or Gough straight to the 101/280. Restaurants are in the $$$ range but all 4 star+ no matter what guide you use. The restaurants in the Russian Hill area are more candle lit date spots than a place to grab a bite with your buddies.4) Noe Valley - I live here now. Parking is easy, the 280 entrance is right around the corner. But not much to do in regards to 21+ scene. Mostly newlyweds and new parents in the area. The Mission and Castro are close, but they're not quite walking distance due to all the hills.Other notes: Also, this is a funny cartoon to get the general sense of the people by neighborhood.

This includes neighborhoods like The Mission, The Castro, anywhere downtown, SOMA, the Lower Haight, etc. San Francisco is honestly a tiny city, so living pretty much anywhere affords easy access to cool, interesting things to do.

Not only is it a quick walk to the train in the morning, but in the evening you can always catch a cab at the train station to get you anywhere else in the city you might want to go. You\'re also right at the ramp to 280 if you do want to/have to drive.If you\'re going to be driving, something out in the Mission close to Valencia between, say, 16th and Cesar Chavez is going to put you close to the freeways and within walking distance to lots of "hip" nightlife and would likely be a bit less expensive.There\'s no way in heck that I\'d put myself in the position of having to take Muni or BART to get to Caltrain on a daily basis. Caltrain from SF to MV is 45-60min depending on whether you\'re on a "local" or "baby bullet" (i.e. "express"), and relying on any other form of public transit to get to/from Caltrain\'s going to give you a 1.5hr (good day) to 2hr (bad day) commute.

However in College my focus was cheap, free refills, and a good working environment, I was less concerned that the coffee was really high quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I was always passionate about local, independent cafes and while I lived in Chicago I grew to know and love many great small local cafes, spending most of my time in the ones that had great atmospheres and great coffee. Including among these was the amazingly high quality\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Inteligentsia Coffee which I was a customer of from their first cafe which opened up in Boystown and then later their locations downtown in the Loop. In the years since they have expanded to a cafe in LA and are among the growing Third Wave of cafes and local coffee roasters which have spread the serious coffee movement throughout the US and indeed around the globe.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have now lived in the Bay Area for 3 1/2 years, in this time I have seen an explosion of great coffee roasters and cafes, led by a group of local coffee roasters and a growing and large coffee culture here in San Francisco. In this post I will write up some of my current favorite cafes in San Francisco, from time to time I will update this post as new places open or old places close.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a frequent cafe customer I look for a few things in cafes I frequent on a regular basis.Great coffee. This should perhaps go without saying, but it makes a huge difference. There are some cafes whose space & location I love, but which I rarely frequent because the coffee does not match the space.Big tables. I have a theory of cafes. Small tables (think the tiny bistro tables of the traditional French cafe) make it hard to share a table with a stranger and make working on laptops awkward. My favorite cafes have always been the ones with large, oversized tables that promote sharing tables with strangers and allow for easy working with laptops.Free Wifi & Power. Though here I am will to make exceptions. Serious coffee trumps wifi \xe2\x80\x93 I just use my time in those cafes in different ways \xe2\x80\x93 for conversations, for time to catch up on my reading, for time to write offline. Later this year I expect I will have a portable data card (or tether my iPhone 3GS) so wifi will be less of an issue. Power too is easy to work around and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst thing to get up and move after 4+ hours in front of my laptop.Happy employees. The best cafes have happy, passionate employees. Employess who are treated well, who do their work with attention to detail and passion for quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other factors I look for in great cafes. Good food is always welcome especially if locally sourced. And being open late fits my lifestyle well. Thankfully in San Francisco I have many options.My not so short list of great cafes in San Francisco:Blue Bottle The coffee of choice for most of the top chefs in the Bay Area. Blue Bottle is one the best coffee roasters I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever tasted and their cafes are among the finest I know of anywhere in the world. It all started with their Kiosk in Hayes Valley at 315 Linden St and at the Ferry Building Farmer\xe2\x80\x99s Markets.

At their full cafe on Mint in addition to great coffee prepared with serious attention to detail and more methods of preparation than any other cafe I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, they also have a small but great selection of food options which change during the course of the day. No wifi, but one of my favorite spots for business meetings, especially around conferences at the nearby Moscone Center.Ritual Coffee Roasters. Ritual is rapidly overflowing their storefront location at 1026 Valencia St in the Mission where they removed couches and many tables to make room for their roaster and coffee storage in the back. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have any power outlets, but still manage to almost always have full tables and a line for their fantastic coffee. With only a small selection of food (albiet tasty baked goods) Ritual is a destination for coffee drinking and a spot where many people sit and work. I\xe2\x80\x99m the Foursquare mayor of Ritual on Valencia as a result of my many times a week visits. Ritual also has a smaller cafe inside of Flora Grub Gardens in Bayview at 1634 Jerrold Ave and a new cafe inside of the Oxbow Public Market at 610 First St in Napa. Ritual coffees are served by many great restaurants and cafes as well.Four Barrel Coffee Before they opened their well designed space at 375 Valencia St which features a large onsite coffee roaster and furniture built from reclaimed lumber, Four Barrel served coffee from the rear of their space via a kiosk open to the small alleyway. Founded by serious coffee people, Four Barrel is an example of a cafe that is all about the coffee, they have only a few baked goods and do not have wifi, yet are usually full until closing. They have a few wholesale customers here in SF and are a fantastic addition to the local coffee scene.Epicenter Cafe Another new addition to San Francisco, Epicenter Cafe is located at 764 Harrison. They are not a coffee roaster but take coffee and food very seriously. Their beans are from Barefoot Coffee Roasters in Santa Clara (who also provide coffee to Google \xe2\x80\x93 a company that takes food and drink fairly seriously). The coffee here is fantastic, what I love about the cafe is the space, high quality food, lots of tables, power outlets and free wifi. It is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in SOMA to work and have meetings.Coffee Bar \xe2\x80\x93 Probably my favorite overall cafe in San FranciscoCoffee Bar is located at the corner of Mariposa & Florida in Potrero Hill. The coffee here is from Mr Espresso in Oakland (one of the owners is part of the family that runs Mr Espresso) and is prepared with great attention to detail both as espresso shots or on their reasonably priced Clover machines. But it is the space and food which is why I so love Coffee Bar. They have a great menu of food and drinks including wine and beer and a multi-leveled space which has been designed with great attention to detail. They have a long bar with underbar power outlets perfect for working alone as well as many oversized tables perfect for groups or for sharing with others. On Thursdays and Fridays they turn the kitchen over to Radio Africa Kitchen which offers some of the best food in San Francisco at extremely reasonable prices. I find the location, food, and ambiance combine to make Coffee Bar one of my favorite cafes and a highly productive space either for working on my laptop or for having great business meetings.Philz coffee is a family run establishment here in San Francisco which has been expanding rapidly in the last few years, going from just a few locations when I first moved here to a growing number of locations throughout the Bay Area. Philz does not make espresso, instead they make coffee one cup at a time from their 20+ custom blends. Blends whose exact mixes they keep secret, but which are each unique and quite tasty. This is a $3+ single cup of coffee which is worth every penny. They have free wifi and a small selection of baked goods, but the main attraction is the amazing and very unique coffee. Coffee which is quite unlike any cup I\xe2\x80\x99ve had anywhere else. Philz is a unique and welcome addition to the coffee culture in San Francisco and now the greater Bay Area.Haus Coffee is a very new addition to San Francisco, opening just weeks ago, Haus Coffee is located at 3082 24th St. A beautiful, if minimalist space which soon will have a fantastic back patio, Haus serves coffee from Ritual Roasters. They have free wifi, large tables and very bright and airy space, with a fireplace for cool San Francisco evenings. One of my new favorite spots.Velo Rouge Cafe is a small cafe just blocks from Golden Gate Park at 798 Arguello Boulevard. They serve coffee from Ritual Roasters expertly prepared along with a great menu featuring local foods. Tasty food, great drinks and a fun space with a small be welcome set of tables outdoors. One of my favorite cafes in the Richmond district of San Francisco and a frequent stop on long weekend walks.Hollow, by far the smallest cafe on my list, is a tiny space in the Inner Sunset at 1435 Irving St. In a space smaller than my first studio apartment, around 400 sq ft nestled between other retail shops,\xc2\xa0 coffee from Ritual Roasters compliments the small but carefully selected products for sale. They have two tables inside with seating for only a few people, but the coffee is fantastic, the shopping excellent and owners friendly. A small gem of a cafe & design shop. Later this summer they will add a table outside. I spent a wonderful afternoon on a recent weekend drinking coffee and chatting with the owner.Mojo Bicycle Cafe is a cafe in the front, a bike shop in the back, Mojo Bicycle Cafe at 639A Divisadero St is a cafe and bar, serving a small selection of food and coffee from De La Paz & Ritual Roasters. Great coffee, good drink selection and you can buy a bike or get your bike repaired while you hang out. A small but fun space with a devoted customer base.The Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is another fairly new addition to San Francisco, the Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is a small cafe which opened up earlier this year next door to Cafe Du Nord nightclub & the Swedish American hall event space. Located at 2168 Market St the cafe features coffee from Ritual Roasters and very tasty food. The sandwiches are particularly good and go well with the great coffee. The free wifi is nice, though the space is a bit small and tables slightly crowded together, I have worked here but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t ideal for long working sessions.Cafe Du Soleil is a French cafe at 200 Filmore, just a block off of Haight St, has good but not fantastic coffee which is more than made up for having great food and a very French atmosphere. This is an adult cafe where you can enjoy great food, wine and coffee along with the free wifi and large communal table. The baked goods are exceptional and the ambiance makes this one of my favorite places to work in San Francisco. The coffee is good, but not as serious as at most of the other places on this list.Samovar Tea Lounge to end this list a place that does not serve coffee at all. Samovar Tea Lounge has three locations in San Francisco (297 Page Street at Laguna, Yerba Buena Gardens at 730 Howard St above the Moscone Center, and 498 Sanchez St in the Castro). Samovar is a place for serious tea and great food. I love coffee but I also am a serious fan of Tea, Samovar has the best tea I have found in San Francisco, served with patience and food that compliments the teas exceptionally well. The Yerba Buena Gardens location is another of my favorite spots for downtown business meetings but also for first dates. It transitions well from a relaxed environment for long conversations and relaxation to a great place for a first date.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other great cafes in San Francisco, cafes with loyal fans, friendly staff, tasty food and beverages but these are the places I return to again and again, the spots I take out of town guests to, the places I plan my day around visiting.source: http://slowbrand.com/2009/06/10/...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 24, 'answer_user': 'Roderick Chow'}, {'answer': 'Both Grove Cafes stay open late and are a good place to work from.There is one on Mission/3rd open till 11 PM every day.

Simpson "Dream Team" of lawyers, got busted for DUI by the SFPD in the early 1980s. He challenged the arrest in what was at time (maybe still) the longest misdemeanor trial in California history. He beat the rap. He wrote a book about the experience with a similarly long title, "How To Protect Yourself Against Cops in California and Other Strange Places." I read the book when I was doing a lot of DUI enforcement. Most of his advice would not be especially valuable to the typical driver. He advises refusing all tests, which will make for a stronger defense case, but will cause you to lose your driver\'s license for at least a year. Bailey could probably afford to take a cab or pay a driver, but most of us aren\'t that flush. He could also bury the prosecution with expert witnesses and investigator testimony, which also most of us can\'t afford. His legal strategy was similar to O.J.\'s: if you don\'t care what it costs and are willing to throw every conceivable defense into the mix, you can probably beat almost any rap.

It happens fairly simply: a person either mistakenly believes that they are under the limit of 0.08 BAC and okay to drive; or, a person drives despite knowing that they are over the limit. Next, they come into contact with a police officer. This is typically either at a traffic stop or a DUI checkpoint. Then, they start providing information that is helpful to the police officer\'s effort to gather evidence. Such as:"I only had a couple of drinks...""I was just headed home from the club...""Those bottles of booze in the trunk are actually my mom\'s..."The police officer is already making notes of your allegedly red eyes, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, disheveled appearance and the offensive scent of alcohol on your breath. Next the police officer will ask you to take some field sobriety tests. Most people don\'t know they are optional and designed to make you look bad. The police officer will say that after observing you take the tests, he or she believes you are under the influence of alcohol. He may ask you to take a PAS test, (portable breathalyzer) which is also optional. Next, he will arrest you and take you to the police station. You will be advised that under California implied consent law, you must take a blood or breath test. You can refuse and force them to get a warrant. However, for most cases, it is probably best to take the breath test. Sometime the next day, you will be released. As soon as you have yourself together, you should contact an experienced DUI attorney. You only have ten days in which to contact the DMV. Otherwise, your license will be suspended. A California DUI lawyer can guide you through the process and right to have your case reduced or dismissed. If you can\'t afford an attorney, the court will appoint you a public defender.Embed QuoteThis answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.... (more)Loading...

{'qid': 186, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85What is it like to go to medical school at a non-university, as compared with a medical school at a university?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'I go to medical school at UCSF, which is a health-sciences university in San Francisco. It has no affiliated undergraduate campus, and its various hospitals, research facilities, and schools are peppered in four locations throughout our fine city, with one additional campus in Fresno, CA. How\'s that for a "non-university" campus?! I\'ve never attended a medical school with an affiliated undergraduate divison, and my undergraduate institution didn\'t have a medical school attached to it (UC Berkeley). However, here are the things that I probably missed out on and\xc2\xa0 the things that I appreciate about my school: Lack of Non-Science OpportunitiesThe biggest adjustment for me has been the lack of random liberal arts seminars/classes/groups that I used to take for granted as being part of any university. The diversity of extracurricular interests/organizations is very sparse here. For example, I played jazz in college with some student groups and was hoping to keep that up in medical school. My school obviously has no jazz department and no established jazz groups of any kind. I truly miss being at a university where I could hop to a business seminar or join the sailing club "just because." It would have helped in balancing my life a little more and in pursuing my interests outside of medicine. Another major issue is the difficulty in attaining a dual-degree - unless it\'s an MPH, you\'ll have to leave the university to pursue your MBA, MPP, MHA, etc. School Social Life The fragmentation of the university can make it hard to meet non-medical students here. Pharmacy, dental, physical therapy and nursing are located at the main campus, but the PhD\'s and other researchers are peppered throughout the city. Social events and mixers aren\'t well-attended. Sometimes you just want to meet (or date) people who aren\'t somehow working in hospitals, but that\'s hard to find on campus. Fortunately, my school is also in a bustling city so I still meet great new people, but with the amount of time medical students spend on campus, the social diversity is still an issue .\xc2\xa0 Additionally, school spirit and name recognition are low at health-sciences schools for obvious reasons. We have no football team, mascot or undergraduate university that makes us famous around the nation. Unless people work in health or are from the area, most folks have no idea what UCSF is. When I go abroad, there is zero chance anybody has ever heard of it. Personally, I don\'t really care. And UCSF does have its own school spirit, but it\'s mainly based on how much pride we have in what we do and not on rah-rah college reputations. Phenomenal Health Science Opportunities Although my school very predictably couldn\'t offer the social or interdisciplinary opportunities a place like Harvard Medical School could, UCSF\'s basic science, translational science, and clinical research opportunities are brilliant. Since the school can devote all of its resources and endowment to medical research, teaching, and healthcare, everything we do is cutting-edge and medical students are loved for just getting involved. Anybody can write a paper or do independent research or start a community health project. Not many universities except health-science-only universities have medical, nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, dental, AND basic science programs, so the work done here is incredibly thorough, inter-professional, and well-informed. If you have an interest in ANY healthcare topic you can think of, UCSF has someone here you can get involved with. It\'s a well-oiled healthcare machine.Great Clinical Experience\xc2\xa0 Again, all of UCSF\'s resources go into health students, and the education here is top-of-the-line. The medical school, as (I tend to assume) the de-facto flagship of the institution, gets a great deal of attention in this respect (and though I can\'t be certain, I would say more attention than medical schools at places with undergrads attached). My university\'s mission is health-care based, so our school administration spends all of their time devoted to improving our learning. Our curriculum is almost always at the forefront of progressive teaching. Our students can train at essentially any clinic or hospital within a 30 mile radius of San Francisco. And our third-year clerkships come in six different flavors, only one of which is the traditional rotation-based track at most schools. We have incredible patient experiences way before third-year starts, and the administration pays very close attention to each and every one of us. I\'ll add more points if they come to me. Although there are negatives, I am happy that I\'ve come to a health-sciences campus. The medical training is incredible, and that\'s what I came here for.Embed QuoteVia  James Pan.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 7, 'answer_user': 'Sofia Noori'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 25, 23, 55), 'tag': ['Medical School', 'University of California, San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Alex K.

My guess is that cabs being more tightly regulated on the airport proper are likely to grumble but not refuse at SFO. But in order to "hail" a cab at SFO all you need is to use the Uber app on your phone and to summon a car once you are outside and ready. It\'s best for the driver if you don\'t do this while waiting to get off the plane.

You can probably make it to the airport in time for a 6am flight, but you are cutting it close. American Airporter is another good alternative. Lorries Airport Shuttle is the local GO Brand and is another good option.SuperShuttle generally gets bad reviews because they cart you all over the entire city at times. If you pick a provider like Airport Express SF, which does not serve the Sunset or Richmond neighborhoods, or anything west of the Presidio, you are much less likely to be carted around the city on your way to the airport.

They claim to be able to satisfy any time of the day, so that is a good option for early rides, and unlike other rideshare services like UberX, Sidecar and Lyft, Tickengo specializes in airports and takes advanced reservations.Another option is Flightcar (http://www.flightcar.com), which allows you to drive your car to the airport, park it there for free, and make money by letting them rent out your car. It's part of the whole collaborative consumption/economy trend, but you need to be willing to lend out your car to randoms. You get paid for everyday the car is rented, and if it isn't rented you still get free parking.

Thus someone with a medallion today only needs to drive a minimal number of shifts to continue to qualify and can rent the use out the rest of the time. So you can theoretically drive a few days a month and for the rest of the month expect to receive a few thousand dollars in exchange for "loaning" use of your medallion.

The cost of gas comes out of the drivers pocket. That means that when gas prices go up, you are being subsidized by the driver who takes a hit at the gas pump for carrying you around. Every once in a great while the city raises the rates to adjust for cost of living and then the drivers sort of marginally catch up (not really, since they don\'t make up what they lost in the past) and the public for a short time (until the oil companies decide there is a "shortage" again) are on a par closer to what the driver is experiencing.In my personal opinion, the cost of taxt fares (as well as Uber) should be closely tied to the cost of gas and fluctuate with it. Instead the drivers make a donation at the pump for their customers. This is one of the blatantly inequal facts of driving for a living. Everyone profits but the driver, who is in a constantly declining rate of return, only to be "adjusted" briefly, so the city can say how fair they are by adjusting the taxi rates. Medalions have little to do with this and adding more would not lower or raise the price, only the competition to the existing drivers.After responding I noticed that the fare increase was actually\xc2\xa0 eight months ago and the actual most recent rise in fuel has been in the last couple of months. My costs went from $40 or so a night to $65 or so a night, and recently due to a decline, back down to below $60. All the same, don\'t forget that the drivers are the ones who bear the brunt of most of the decisions long before the public. The public might complain for a time and everyone listens to them, cab drivers complain and everyone dismisses it as "just cab drivers whining". I can tell you they do actually have some foundation for what they say, regardless of whether they are lazy slobs who don\'t really want to work or those of us who work as hard as the buisness available will allow.Embed QuoteVia  Steve Davis.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Peter Ashlock'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 6, 16, 9, 7), 'tag': ['San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Taxis', 'San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Steve Davis'}

The general idea is that drivers and riders use mobile phones connected to a web service to arrange rides. The drivers, some professional, are paid in various ways.

Lyft and Sidcar are generally offering taxi prices while Uber is ten times as expensive and UberX (meant to compete with Lyft & Sidecar) three times for a ten-mile tip.\xc2\xa0Based on the (questionable) theory that one is willing to spend a fixed, very small percentage one one\xe2\x80\x99s net worth, the 30% of people in the US who have a net worth of $250,000 or more would pay $50. So maybe Uber\xe2\x80\x99s prices are not as outrageous as they appear. Some real market data would help here.\xc2\xa0The large price gap suggests that lower cost services might charge a bit more if the additional revenue could be used to make the quality of service predictably high. \xc2\xa0There is an opportunity for new services is to provide significantly better service than incumbents who have not upgraded service in fifty years. The new models have potential advantages:There seems to be no regulatory limit on the number of drivers, and GPS allows many more people to be effective navigators of cities. Currently, several services seem to be understaffed with drivers; and there is intense competition for them.When drivers supply their own cars, there is no capital investment needed by the service and the drivers might be better.Many sophisticated dispatching, traffic prediction, and demand management computer tricks can be tried, copying from the airlines.Detailed feedback on every transaction, on both rider and driver, might produce better service eventually.Current urban culture seems to reduce car ownership.Current employment conditions encourage part-time driving jobs for those who own cars.However, we are a little dubious about the potential for providing notably better service than today\xe2\x80\x99s taxis when the drivers are still independent contractors. The organizations with really great service\xe2\x80\x94Disney, Zappos, Marriott, etc.\xe2\x80\x94typically have permanent employees, extensive training, and a highly developed culture. An interesting test comparison of this issue can be found in UPS vs. Fedex. UPS\xe2\x80\x99s delivery people are permanent employees belonging to union. Fedex\xe2\x80\x99s are contractors. As a result Fedex\xe2\x80\x99s labor rates are roughly half of UPS\xe2\x80\x99s; but their service is inferior, especially for ground service. None of the companies seem to have plans to greatly exceed the service levels of existing services. Lyft and Sidecar offer taxi-quality service, and Uber offers limousine-quality service. There are some entirely independent drivers who have developed continuing relationships with customers by providing superb, personalized service. There may be an opportunity to become the Zappos of taxi service, but the method is not clear.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 44, 'answer_user': 'Jim Morris'}, {'answer': "So, I think that in order to answer this, the answer has to be broken down into two items: overall company (culture, people, experience) and technology.I'll start by noting that I've used both services and I like them a lot. However, Lyft has moved itself onto the homescreen of my iPhone for a number of reasons.Company: A lot of the next paragraph is likely subjective, but this is just how I'm calling it. I like the Lyft culture better. I've had more friendly drivers, I think the #lyftbump - though some say silly - is a fun and quirky tradition, much like the pink mustaches. It's these quirks that help bring together a stronger sense of culture that ultimately builds into a community.Those pink mustaches also make the process of identifying your driver as he/she approaches much easier when using Lyft. When using Sidecar, there's those awkward moments when I step toward a card that I think is my ride and then back off after realizing it's not. Technology: Some of the other answers make the point creating a profile and having to authenticate with Facebook. That's a very fair point, and I certainly understand why many people prefer to avoid Facebook authentication. However, in my mind, there is one functional step of the software that actually makes a huge difference in my experience. With Lyft, you don't have to state your end destination in the app when you request a ride. With Sidecar, as of the last time I used it, this is not the case - you have to state your end destination.This is a problem for Sidecar for two reasons. The first is that it means drivers can ignore my request if they don't like my destination request (for example, if I want to go somewhere way out like Dogpatch or Outer Sunset). The second reasons it hurts my experience is that it eliminates all use cases where I may be traveling with a friend who wants to get dropped off halfway. When I input my destination, the driver is given a route that they are supposed to take. Any deviations or stops not on this route are generally frowned upon and supposedly the drivers will get a call asking them where on earth they're taking the passenger? Anyway, this causes a lot of Sidecar drivers to not want to take any passenger that wants to make multiple stops. Lyft on the other hand, handles this just fine and drivers are happy to fulfill this sort of request.That's my two cents.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 25, 'answer_user': 'Zach Cole'}, {'answer': 'Another driver\'s perspective - I have signed up as a driver for both and have gone through the training for both services.\xc2\xa0 From my initial impression, Sidecar comes across as a grassroots, entrepreneurial effort, and Lyft comes across as a corporate driven tech company.\xc2\xa0 Lyft seems to have deeper pockets - they give bonuses for referrals, they staff all have the latest macbooks and fancy technology.\xc2\xa0 But they also require you to give you availability and give you shifts that you are required to work.

If I had to pick one, I\'d go with Sidecar since availability trumps everything else.Here\'s my view on Lyft versus Sidecar:Availability - As mentioned before, I use both services regularly but I find that Sidecar is more reliable during off-peak hours. I believe that the Sidecar has more drivers on the road during daytime hours as I have had trouble getting a Lyft during these times. In addition, Sidecar has been piloting a feature where you can book an occupied driver if their end point is near you. Lyft wouldn\'t be able to do this. Edge: SidecarPricing / Checkout - In terms of actual cost, both are fairly even. However, I like that Sidecar gives me a cost estimate before I enter the car so I\'m never surprised. There are cases where the avg. donation (on both Lyft & Sidecar) is actually more expensive than a cab ride in which case I\'d take a cab. Lyft doesn\'t let me price shop. In addition, it bothers me that Lyft automatically collects a "suggested donation" if you don\'t donate at the end. Edge: SidecarDrivers - There\'s been a lot of hype on the Lyft culture and brand. While I do appreciate the fist bump, I\'ve had fun (and not so fun) drivers on both services. Lyft, however, seems to have a slight edge in terms of fun rides. Edge: Lyft Brand Marketing - This is where Lyft is doing extremely well. I\'ve heard many people talk about the iconic pink mustaches. It\'s a nice way to market the service and build buzz; Sidecar doesn\'t really have much in terms of branding. Edge: Lyft Referrals - Sidecar has a $10 referral program that they actively (possibly aggressively) promote. It\'s what got me hooked on the service and my first two months of rides were paid purely off referrals bonuses. I don\'t know of any referral program for riders on Lyft. Edge: SidecarEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 18, 'answer_user': 'Saikat Bhadra'}, {'answer': 'I personally love being a Lyft driver (and passenger) because I get to have such a down-to-earth experience with every passenger in my car. The fist-bump is a subtle little "hello" instead of the standard handshake (which feels too formal and boring), and every passenger is welcome to change the music, charge their iPhones, change the temperature of the car, and chat with us on whatever subject they want - just like being in their best friend\'s car. The passenger-driver vibe is what makes the Lyft culture so unique and fun. Lyft drivers are happy to go above and beyond for their passengers - providing mints and gum, carrying groceries up three flights of stairs, or transforming the inside of the car to a fun photobooth on weekend nights - it\'s the little touches (and personalities) drivers bring to the experience that make it unique. Many drivers (including myself) have even found new friends among the passengers we drive.My two cents on a few things: Lyft culture: I\'ve worked at a few companies prior to Lyft, one of which was a startup. What I can say is that the team at Lyft is the most genuine you\'ll ever meet in terms of a startup company, however large or small. Lyft is run by Zimride, which has been around for over four years; they do have a very professional team, which is a good thing from my perspective. From my experience as a driver for Lyft, I\'ve always felt like part of the team and welcome at the HQ.\xc2\xa0 There is nothing yuppie or fake about the culture of Lyft/Zimride.For the drivers, Lyft organizes regular Driver Hangouts so that all drivers can get to know each other, swap stories, and offer tips on how to make the passenger experience even better. It\'s a fun way to keep the driver community familiar and friendly. Safety and support:The Lyft support team is always available via phone, email, or social media to help passengers and drivers if the need comes up. They take safety and customer support super seriously and have always been there when I\'ve needed them, even at crazy hours. Their system tracks driver and passenger info and locations all the time, which puts my mind at ease that I\'m covered if something weird happens.Insurance:As a driver, this is huge for me. Lyft recently got a $1 million excess liability insurance policy, which kicks in above drivers\' own auto insurance. Sidecar says they *will* have insurance, but it doesn\'t look like they have it yet.\xc2\xa0 I feel much better knowing there\'s backup coverage for me and my passengers if anything ever happens.Driver vetting: As I\'ve been with Lyft for a long while now, I\'ve seen the driver community grow tremendously. From what I can gather, the interview and training process at Lyft is very rigorous to ensure we have a great group of drivers. In turn, drivers are encouraged to recommend friends and family they know who would be great drivers, which helps keep the fun culture that all of our passengers have come to expect and enjoy. And just to clear one thing up - now that Lyft is launched out of beta, drivers are only compensated by passenger donations.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 63, 'answer_user': 'Nancy Tcheou'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 5, 8, 52), 'tag': ['Uber, Lyft, Sidecar Comparisons', 'Zimride', 'San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Sidecar', 'Lyft', 'Ride-Sharing', 'Uber'], 'question_user': 'Jennifer Jones'}
{'qid': 232, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Following the January 9th UberX price cuts, how do UberX rates compare with Lyft and Sidecar in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': "Overall, UberX's fare changes price them significantly below their competitors during normal hours. Based on a quick sampling I've found that UberX fares are between 10-25% below that of Lyft & Sidecar. In particular, longer distance trips to East Bay look significantly cheaper. This is an interesting move because it's possible that Uber can price cut Lyft & Sidecar out of the market because Uber\xc2\xa0 has a very high margin business (black cars) that they can rely on cash flow along with >$300M in VC funding. It will be interesting to see how their competitors try to build a defensible moat outside of pricing.Some caveats:Surge Pricing - If UberX has surge pricing, then during these periods UberX will definitely not be competitive with Sidecar & Lyft. From what I recall, surge pricing multipliers start at the 1.5X range. Surge pricing regularly occurs during weekend evenings, so during this period Lyft & Sidecar will be cheaper by a long shot.UberX Fares - Fare estimates are based the in app calculator. All other fares listed below are actual fares.High Traffic Fares- Sidecar is the only competitor which locks in fares prior to the rate. Thus, I've found that Sidecar can be priced best during high traffic periods where your ride is in gridlock (i.e. office traffic). During these times, your Uber / Lyft fares will jack up as part of the formula is time, while Sidecar largely prices on distance.So to summarize, the cheapest player during: Normal hours - UberX High traffic - SidecarHigh demand - Lyft / SidecarSample SF FaresUnfortunately, you can't price shop with Lyft as they don't have a fare estimator so many of these routes lack a Lyft fare .

They take 20% of the action for their overheads, which does seem reasonable.No matter what you do, do not believe the 'nudge nudge, wink wink' treatment that your potential co-worker drivers at Lyft or Sidecar may say about this income not being taxable income - it absolutely is. Only when the costs are ridesharing costs ($0.565/mile or less) can they be viewed as non-commercial. We've heard that Lyft will issue you 1099's, which is the appropriate thing to do, so you can report this commercial income on your taxes.Anecdotal information gleaned from some Sidecar and Lyft drivers indicates that they earn between $600-$1,200 per week, depending on which shifts they choose to work.\xc2\xa0 That would work out to about $30/hour. That information was obtained in San Francisco, of course, where there is an undersupply of taxis and so, consequently, relatively high demand for these peer-to-peer taxi services.

Originally, Lyft guaranteed $18/hour, but they don't seem to be doing that any more, according to information we've read on the internet.Most of the drivers we've spoken to are between jobs or doing it part time while attending school, and that's a great option.Finally, for the record, Lyft and Sidecar are not 'ridesharing' as ridesharing is synonymous with carpooling.

These services can be quality services and very competitive, although a guy I work with paid $25 using Sidecar for a 4.6 mile journey vs. his friend took the same journey and paid $18 using a regular taxi. By contrast, using Avego ridesharing, if you were simply to split the cost of the drive, this would cost $1.72 - ten times cheaper than a taxi, or 14 times cheaper than Sidecar in this case. I'm told Lyft is about the same price as a taxi, although again I've heard from a friend that on shorter rides Lyft could be perhaps $1 more than a taxi.In general, Avego has calculated in other cities, taxi services charge about 9 times the cost of ridesharing: a couple of dollars per mile on average versus the average of $0.25 that ride sharers pay (ridesharing is generally capped at the IRS reimbursement rate, which as of June 2013 is set at $0.565 per mile.There is a lot of feedback online from people about both Lyft and Sidecar.

So if you're driving a passenger across town, long runs to the airport, paying bridge toll, driving a passenger to Palo Alto, the passenger has the option of donating nothing to you as a community driver. Meeting new people, discovering new places in the city & being a friend giving a ride to another friend should be your motivation. Some passengers are cheap & donate $4.00 to driving from point A to B in 30 mins. So your time, gas & wear & tear on your vehicle is worth $4.00, or $8.00 an hour. After that, SideCar gets 20% of that $8.00. This is only when you pick up cheapskate passengers that never tip AND donate less than the suggested amt. That's just human nature. Driving for SideCar, Lyft or Uber X puts alot of miles on your vehicle. So you might make $400 this week & end up spending $1500 next month on car maintenance such as catalytic converter, new struts or brakes, etc. Another problem being a SideCar driver is some passenger cheat by entering a closer destination than the actual destination to get a lower suggested donation amt and request that you pick up two other friends at different location then drop them off at different different residence.\xc2\xa0 If you don't, you'll get a one star rating & terminated as a sidecar driver for having low rating. According to the SideCar fare calculator, the suggested donation for this ride is $6.40. The passenger can choose to donate .50 cents because that's all s/he can afford.Another problem with SideCar is it doesn't have a cancellation fee. Good for passengers, bad for drivers. So if it takes 10-15min to get to your pick-up location & you found out that your passenger got a taxi or changed it's mind, you just wasted your time & gas.

As a side note, fist bumps are more hygienic than handshakes(http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/...).Embed QuoteVia  Ryhan Hassan.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 11, 'answer_user': 'Chris Grant'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 2, 0, 5), 'tag': ['Lyft', 'Lyft Drivers & Driving for Lyft', 'San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Sidecar', 'Ride-Sharing', 'Taxis', 'Uber'], 'question_user': 'Ryhan Hassan'}

{'qid': 243, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Does the relationship between transportation and urban form resemble the dilemma of the chicken and the egg?', 'answers': [{'answer': "The two are deeply related, but I would argue for a different relationship than you imply.Urban form is very highly dependent on population density. In America, the real determinant of density is the age of a city. Any city built primarily before automobiles became popular (pre-1940) has a dense, walkable urban form and cities that were built after that generally do not. There are exceptions to this, but less than you would think. Portland, for example, despite being held up as an example of modern urban planning, is not very dense by the standards of San Francisco, New York, or even less well-known dense older cities such as Baltimore and Buffalo.Density does tend to determine typical modes of transportation in a place, as public transit is not efficient when a place is very spread out. Low-density places are necessarily car-dependent, whereas high-density places tend to be more transit-oriented because the systems don't need to be as heavily subsidized, so the government can afford to run them. If a place is car-dependent, you need space for a lot of parking, which generally occupies 1-2x as much square footage as the building itself, effectively making good urban form impossible, since no one walks through seas of parking by choice.Once public transit is in place, then people walk more, since they have to walk from the bus or subway stop to their work and might stop at a pastry shop on the way. People walking creates good urban form, with businesses built up to the street providing a wide diversity of services.So, I would argue that it is not a chicken-and-egg scenario, exactly.Rather, both are dependent on density, and the relationship goes: Density creates transit creates walkable urbanism.Pseudo-examples of this do exist in places like Denver and Portland that are more car-dependent, but those are small areas of urbanism with parking lots a few blocks away. For true, widespread, good urbanism, I would argue that the relationship above is the only way to create it.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'LaLuce Mitchell'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 2, 17, 0, 12), 'tag': ['London Taxis', 'San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Metropolitan Transit Authority', 'New Urbanism', 'Subways', 'Public Transport', 'New York City Subway (MTA)', 'Taxis', 'Urban Planning', 'Transportation', 'Cycling', 'Civil Engineering'], 'question_user': 'Matthew Hartzell'}

{'qid': 259, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': "\xc3\xa2\xc2\x98\xc2\x85What is the best thing to do about the San Francisco Giants' woeful defense this season?", 'answers': [{'answer': "Some thoughts...Catcher - We should find a way to bring Chris Stewart back from the Yankees! He's a terrible hitter but an outstanding defensive catcher, and a much better Posey stand-in than Hector Sanchez. I say they find a new defensive backup catcher (not sure if any of the current guys qualify) and either trade Sanchez or let him develop in the minors. The Giants won't do this because they have such a weak bench they need a backup catcher who can hit a bit. They also want an heir apparent for Posey, who will eventually find himself at 1st or 3rd.First Base - Belt is an outstanding defensive first baseman and he has a lot of years to get better before age becomes an issue. Second Base - Scutaro is an exceptional contact hitter but his age is showing at second. Personally, my favorite part of a Giants game is watching Scutaro hit, so I say play him as often as possible and live with the defense. With that said, a late inning replacement would be a good idea, and while Arias can do it he's more valuable at SS and more needed at 3rd. However, since the Giants are so weak on the bench, they can't afford to keep a weak-hitting replacement on the roster to cover second (such as Noonan or one of these other young guys). Shortstop - Crawford is somewhere between good and great defensively and between mediocre and good at the plate, certainly good enough that the Giants are committed to keeping him at SS for the foreseeable future. Third Base - Pablo just need to commit to being a major league baseball player and keep himself fit. If that happens, he may be more than sufficient at 3rd base. If not, or if fitness isn't the only issue, this is a position that could use an upgrade on offense and defense. Posey may be the solution, but that whole situation could go a lot of ways.Outfield - Whether it's Blanco or Perez, the giants have an option for a base-stealing backup outfielder who can shine defensively when needed. Pence and Pagan are solid defenders and they're not going anywhere. Left field is the obvious deficiency, but honestly, offense is going to be the factor here, not defense. Nonetheless, I don't think anyone criticizes the Giants outfield defense when it's Pence, Pagan, Blanco, but I'd bet on defense weakening when they find a new everyday left fielder. I'm not sure when this question was posted, but defense seems to have stabilized for the Giants this season. Not great, but not terrible. And although the offense has been rightly criticized, we need to remember that it's basically these same team that just won the World Series. The real problem is pitching, primarily starting pitching, and I hope to see that addressed before offense or defense. I don't think it's a coincidence that the hitting declined in tandem with the pitching - hitting was actually among the best in the majors for the first month or so of the season. Then the pitching really suffered, and offense followed.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 0, 'answer_user': 'Anonymous User'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 8, 8, 45), 'tag': ['San Francisco Giants', 'Sports in San Francisco', 'MLB', 'Baseball'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

With live entertainment a food retailer can stay open until 2am, but they're hard to get, and cost so much you might as well get a permit to sell alcohol as well.There are a few special use districts, like the food truck ghetto across from Costco, where a mobile fast food retailer can stay open until 2.

I've also spent cumulative months in New York City and London, the former having plenty of late-night options, the latter not. My theory is that late-night places need a relatively wide geographic/population coverage area funneling in to be sustainable.In Dallas and Austin, most people have cars and can drive to places like Kerbey Lane, the 24 Diner, or Epoch Coffee at any hour from nearly anywhere in the metropolitan area. So, even a relatively low density of night owls is enough, when concentrated via transport, to sustain a decent number of businesses.In New York City, people don't generally have cars, but there's substantial public transportation (even subways) at all hours. Such transit is possible partly because the subway lines have many bypasses allowing concurrent transport service and maintenance. London and SF have to shut down their rail transit nightly for maintenance.In San Francisco and London, cars are also rare, but there are only skeleton transit services past 11 or 12pm at night. The food and coffee options in either place are pretty bad past 10 or 11pm. The ones that do exist either have parking (The Lucky Penny and the IHOP on Lombard) or are in night life/tourist areas (Sparky's and Pinecrest).I'm wondering if there are good counter-examples: metro areas over 1M people with (1) poor late-night transit options and good late-night coffee/dining or (2) solid late-night transit options (in the form of public transit or car-centrality) and bad late-night options.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 10, 'answer_user': 'David Strauss'}, {'answer': "I think the real reason is the high minimum wage.

Kopi-Tarik may work better because you have a large segment of gourmet coffee drinkers already. You don't have the same for tea. The recipe will also be important. There has to be something different that can justify the cost. My thought is spiced tea - cinnamon or nutmeg or a mixture of spices passed down the generations from the first time..... That gives a good backstory. The fundemental problem, as I see it, is that Teh-Tarik isn't that special. I've had something similar in the a British army, in Kenya, in India and in Ethiopia.

It's also a small joy to watch them blaze through a long line, the employees have a smooth working rapport.I end up at the Mint Plaza location very often, it's probably the second best location after Heath.

The Summit - The newest addition to the scene, this place is basically built for startups. There are good working areas as well as more social areas. The best way to become popular here is to bring a 3-outlet adapter.Ritual Coffee Roasters - A traditional hotspot for caffeine & code.Haus - While this place attracts some startup people, it\'s not a great place for a conversation. Better for putting your headphones on, cranking your preferred SomaFM station, and getting things done.Honorable mention: Stable, Atlas, Philz, Sugarlump, Morning Due Cafe...SF - SOMA:Epicenter Cafe - Absolutely teeming with startups. It\'s ridiculous. Also at the cutting edge of sustainability (they won a Carrotmob!).Blue Bottle Coffee - There are shockingly few good independent coffee shops right near downtown. The Blue Bottle at Mint Plaza ends up attracting a whole lot of movers and shakers. Unfortunately, there\'s not a lot of room to sit and work, nor can you really have a meal. Best for quick meetings.Caffe Centro - Right in the middle of South Park, great for meetings or lunch. Definitely a startup hub.Crossroads Cafe - A bit off the beaten path (unless you are working at Dogpatch Labs), but a great spot. As far as startup-oriented patrons, this place has quality, not quantity. This is where I first met my co-founder at my first company.Honorable mention: Brainwash, The Grove, Samovar...Palo Alto:Coupa Cafe - Everyone here is doing a startup. Good luck getting a table.Philz - I mean, it\'s hardly worth listing them... all coffee shops in Palo Alto fall into the "startup hotspot" category.University Cafe - Best for meetings and pitches, not so much for laptops.The CoHo - It\'s easy to forget, but the Coffee House on Stanford\'s campus is where you will find the best startup founders a couple years before anyone else finds them.Mountain View:Red Rock - Last time I was there, a remote-controlled robot came in and placed an order. Enough said.Dana Street Roasting Co - Again, you can\'t really go wrong in Mountain View.Oakland:Remedy - This new spot in Temescal feels particularly like a startup-magnet. Mainly in the sense that it seems like it was just magically transported over from the Mission.Berkeley:Free Speech Movement Cafe - In Berkeley, many of the startups are born at the University, so this expansive cafe right in the middle of the campus is a good spot to try.Brewed Awakening - Mostly grad students, but some of them are doing startups.People\'s Coffee and Tea - More undergrads here, and it\'s too quiet to talk non-awkwardly, BUT they\'re open til midnight.Local 123 - This is the best place to get away from the students but still find some startup people. Try the "salty goat" sandwich.That\'s my rundown. This list has been biased towards places which are hip and have a good vibe for working. I also left out Starbucks, Peets, and other big chains (not hip). There are lots of other places which probably contain a lot of startup people, but aren\'t quite as hip (like Maxfield\'s or Muddy Waters in the Mission). There are other places which have lots of startup people, but aren\'t good for working (like Four Barrel Coffee, which doesn\'t offer wifi or outlets, or Buck\'s of Woodside, which is a straight-up restaurant).

{'qid': 289, 'ans_num': 2, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why is Philz coffee different from other hand-poured coffee establishments in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'Multiple reasons. Let me first start by providing context.People sometimes categorize the coffee industry into waves, for example:1st wave = Folgers, Yuban, etc.. 2nd wave = Starbucks, Peet\xe2\x80\x99s, etc...3rd wave = Stumptown, Blue Bottle, etcThe 3rd wave is viewed as a step above the 2nd wave. It\'s artisanal, extra special and high quality. Mostly local coffee companies occupy this category - some small and medium-sized but none very large. 3rd wavers are rising in popularity in America\'s most progressive cities. \xc2\xa0While some may categorize Philz in the 3rd wave, we are different: \xc2\xb7 Vision: Our vision is to reinvent the coffee experience.\xc2\xa0 A cup of Philz is special. You start by ordering with a friendly Barista that helps you choose a blend they think you\'ll like best, craft it for you on the spot, and add anything you want in it to taste (milk, sugar, etc. or black, as many do). You don\'t leave our stores until you are 100% satisfied, but we do pretty well at blowing people\'s socks off after the first sip - our desired outcome :). When people wake up in the morning, I want them to say, "Let\'s go grab a Philz." Instead of \xe2\x80\x9cLets go grab a latte.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xb7 Secret recipe blends: Our secret recipe blends with charming names capture the essence of my dad\'s experience after his first sip. These blends were created by my dad (Phil) over decades, and are made of high quality varietals from around the world.\xc2\xa0 My favorite is the Tesora, a medium roast and our most popular blend.\xc2\xa0 We also offer a few varietals (single origin beans) at most of our stores, which are also really good.\xc2\xb7 Coffee personalized to taste: We believe that the best coffee in the world is the coffee that comes to each person\'s individual taste. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s different and what may taste great to one person may not be good to another.\xc2\xa0 At Philz, there is really something for everyone and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have such a diverse group of awesome customers who visit our stores. \xc2\xb7 Pioneers of the Coffee Bar: When you walk into a Philz, it\xe2\x80\x99s more like a bar than an actual coffee shop with Baristas who act as bartenders. At most artisanal coffee companies, customers pay first for a drink but at Philz, we\'ve reversed the process: order with your Barista, then pay. The reason for this is because we want our customers to interact directly with the Barista making their coffee. \xc2\xb7 Specialization: To focus on being exceptional at personalized, handcrafted coffee we don\'t serve espresso at our stores. When my dad, Phil, first shared the idea of Philz, his friends\' response was along the lines of: "You\'re an idiot.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no way you\'re going to succeed without lattes. You need to have espresso." Thank goodness we didn\'t listen.\xc2\xa0 Every month we convert thousands of latte/espresso drinkers into Philz Phanatics. \xc2\xb7 Local Relevance: Each Philz fits in community it lives in. The real design and build-out of a store begins on day one of opening - the team and community complete the design of each store and it\xe2\x80\x99s never ending. Our people have autonomy. We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s locally relevant.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xb7 Passionate people: The most important people at Philz are the people behind the counter.\xc2\xa0 They are everything.\xc2\xa0 Just like their mission is to better their customers\' days with an amazing coffee experience, our focus as senior leadership is to better their day so they leave their shift saying, "I love working at Philz." (BTW if anyone is interested in joining the Philz team and changing the coffee world, visit us here to learn more. Excuse our career site as it\'s under construction). I don\'t believe we are in the coffee business.\xc2\xa0 I believe we are in the people\'s business serving coffee.\xc2\xa0 After all, coffee is fun.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t take it too seriously.\xc2\xa0 It\'s habitual and part of so many people\'s days.\xc2\xa0 We are fortunate to have the opportunity to touch everyone\'s day with the best damn coffee we can. One day, I want to have 1000 stores, but the way I look at it is having one store 1000 times which means scaling mindfully; preserving the core values we work so hard to uphold every day. \xc2\xa0To really understand what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, I highly recommend you come by and give Philz a try. Let the Barista know if it\xe2\x80\x99s your first time and they will take care of you. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear feedback on peoples experiences.Embed QuoteVia  Miguel Paraz.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 189, 'answer_user': 'Jacob Jaber'}, {'answer': "Philz has a larger variety of coffees on their menu including many flavored coffees, and they'll add sweetener and cream to your coffee on request.

His article, in full:San Francisco Coffee is among the best in the world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am a serious coffee drinker, I started drinking coffee seriously in high school, spent many hours in college in cafes throughout Hyde Park. However in College my focus was cheap, free refills, and a good working environment, I was less concerned that the coffee was really high quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I was always passionate about local, independent cafes and while I lived in Chicago I grew to know and love many great small local cafes, spending most of my time in the ones that had great atmospheres and great coffee. Including among these was the amazingly high quality\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Inteligentsia Coffee which I was a customer of from their first cafe which opened up in Boystown and then later their locations downtown in the Loop. In the years since they have expanded to a cafe in LA and are among the growing Third Wave of cafes and local coffee roasters which have spread the serious coffee movement throughout the US and indeed around the globe.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have now lived in the Bay Area for 3 1/2 years, in this time I have seen an explosion of great coffee roasters and cafes, led by a group of local coffee roasters and a growing and large coffee culture here in San Francisco. In this post I will write up some of my current favorite cafes in San Francisco, from time to time I will update this post as new places open or old places close.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a frequent cafe customer I look for a few things in cafes I frequent on a regular basis.Great coffee. This should perhaps go without saying, but it makes a huge difference. There are some cafes whose space & location I love, but which I rarely frequent because the coffee does not match the space.Big tables. I have a theory of cafes. Small tables (think the tiny bistro tables of the traditional French cafe) make it hard to share a table with a stranger and make working on laptops awkward. My favorite cafes have always been the ones with large, oversized tables that promote sharing tables with strangers and allow for easy working with laptops.Free Wifi & Power. Though here I am will to make exceptions. Serious coffee trumps wifi \xe2\x80\x93 I just use my time in those cafes in different ways \xe2\x80\x93 for conversations, for time to catch up on my reading, for time to write offline. Later this year I expect I will have a portable data card (or tether my iPhone 3GS) so wifi will be less of an issue. Power too is easy to work around and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst thing to get up and move after 4+ hours in front of my laptop.Happy employees. The best cafes have happy, passionate employees. Employess who are treated well, who do their work with attention to detail and passion for quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other factors I look for in great cafes. Good food is always welcome especially if locally sourced. And being open late fits my lifestyle well. Thankfully in San Francisco I have many options.My not so short list of great cafes in San Francisco:Blue Bottle The coffee of choice for most of the top chefs in the Bay Area. Blue Bottle is one the best coffee roasters I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever tasted and their cafes are among the finest I know of anywhere in the world. It all started with their Kiosk in Hayes Valley at 315 Linden St and at the Ferry Building Farmer\xe2\x80\x99s Markets. Now they have an amazing new space at 66 Mint St, a full cafe inside of the Ferry Building and a new location in the rooftop garden of the SF MOMA. At their full cafe on Mint in addition to great coffee prepared with serious attention to detail and more methods of preparation than any other cafe I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, they also have a small but great selection of food options which change during the course of the day. No wifi, but one of my favorite spots for business meetings, especially around conferences at the nearby Moscone Center.Ritual Coffee Roasters. Ritual is rapidly overflowing their storefront location at 1026 Valencia St in the Mission where they removed couches and many tables to make room for their roaster and coffee storage in the back. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have any power outlets, but still manage to almost always have full tables and a line for their fantastic coffee. With only a small selection of food (albiet tasty baked goods) Ritual is a destination for coffee drinking and a spot where many people sit and work. I\xe2\x80\x99m the Foursquare mayor of Ritual on Valencia as a result of my many times a week visits. Ritual also has a smaller cafe inside of Flora Grub Gardens in Bayview at 1634 Jerrold Ave and a new cafe inside of the Oxbow Public Market at 610 First St in Napa. Ritual coffees are served by many great restaurants and cafes as well.Four Barrel Coffee Before they opened their well designed space at 375 Valencia St which features a large onsite coffee roaster and furniture built from reclaimed lumber, Four Barrel served coffee from the rear of their space via a kiosk open to the small alleyway. Founded by serious coffee people, Four Barrel is an example of a cafe that is all about the coffee, they have only a few baked goods and do not have wifi, yet are usually full until closing. They have a few wholesale customers here in SF and are a fantastic addition to the local coffee scene.Epicenter Cafe Another new addition to San Francisco, Epicenter Cafe is located at 764 Harrison. They are not a coffee roaster but take coffee and food very seriously. Their beans are from Barefoot Coffee Roasters in Santa Clara (who also provide coffee to Google \xe2\x80\x93 a company that takes food and drink fairly seriously). The coffee here is fantastic, what I love about the cafe is the space, high quality food, lots of tables, power outlets and free wifi. It is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in SOMA to work and have meetings.Coffee Bar \xe2\x80\x93 Probably my favorite overall cafe in San FranciscoCoffee Bar is located at the corner of Mariposa & Florida in Potrero Hill. The coffee here is from Mr Espresso in Oakland (one of the owners is part of the family that runs Mr Espresso) and is prepared with great attention to detail both as espresso shots or on their reasonably priced Clover machines. But it is the space and food which is why I so love Coffee Bar. They have a great menu of food and drinks including wine and beer and a multi-leveled space which has been designed with great attention to detail. They have a long bar with underbar power outlets perfect for working alone as well as many oversized tables perfect for groups or for sharing with others. On Thursdays and Fridays they turn the kitchen over to Radio Africa Kitchen which offers some of the best food in San Francisco at extremely reasonable prices. I find the location, food, and ambiance combine to make Coffee Bar one of my favorite cafes and a highly productive space either for working on my laptop or for having great business meetings.Philz coffee is a family run establishment here in San Francisco which has been expanding rapidly in the last few years, going from just a few locations when I first moved here to a growing number of locations throughout the Bay Area. Philz does not make espresso, instead they make coffee one cup at a time from their 20+ custom blends. Blends whose exact mixes they keep secret, but which are each unique and quite tasty. This is a $3+ single cup of coffee which is worth every penny. They have free wifi and a small selection of baked goods, but the main attraction is the amazing and very unique coffee. Coffee which is quite unlike any cup I\xe2\x80\x99ve had anywhere else. Philz is a unique and welcome addition to the coffee culture in San Francisco and now the greater Bay Area.Haus Coffee is a very new addition to San Francisco, opening just weeks ago, Haus Coffee is located at 3082 24th St. A beautiful, if minimalist space which soon will have a fantastic back patio, Haus serves coffee from Ritual Roasters. They have free wifi, large tables and very bright and airy space, with a fireplace for cool San Francisco evenings. One of my new favorite spots.Velo Rouge Cafe is a small cafe just blocks from Golden Gate Park at 798 Arguello Boulevard. They serve coffee from Ritual Roasters expertly prepared along with a great menu featuring local foods. Tasty food, great drinks and a fun space with a small be welcome set of tables outdoors. One of my favorite cafes in the Richmond district of San Francisco and a frequent stop on long weekend walks.Hollow, by far the smallest cafe on my list, is a tiny space in the Inner Sunset at 1435 Irving St. In a space smaller than my first studio apartment, around 400 sq ft nestled between other retail shops,\xc2\xa0 coffee from Ritual Roasters compliments the small but carefully selected products for sale. They have two tables inside with seating for only a few people, but the coffee is fantastic, the shopping excellent and owners friendly. A small gem of a cafe & design shop. Later this summer they will add a table outside. I spent a wonderful afternoon on a recent weekend drinking coffee and chatting with the owner.Mojo Bicycle Cafe is a cafe in the front, a bike shop in the back, Mojo Bicycle Cafe at 639A Divisadero St is a cafe and bar, serving a small selection of food and coffee from De La Paz & Ritual Roasters. Great coffee, good drink selection and you can buy a bike or get your bike repaired while you hang out. A small but fun space with a devoted customer base.The Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is another fairly new addition to San Francisco, the Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is a small cafe which opened up earlier this year next door to Cafe Du Nord nightclub & the Swedish American hall event space. Located at 2168 Market St the cafe features coffee from Ritual Roasters and very tasty food. The sandwiches are particularly good and go well with the great coffee. The free wifi is nice, though the space is a bit small and tables slightly crowded together, I have worked here but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t ideal for long working sessions.Cafe Du Soleil is a French cafe at 200 Filmore, just a block off of Haight St, has good but not fantastic coffee which is more than made up for having great food and a very French atmosphere. This is an adult cafe where you can enjoy great food, wine and coffee along with the free wifi and large communal table. The baked goods are exceptional and the ambiance makes this one of my favorite places to work in San Francisco. The coffee is good, but not as serious as at most of the other places on this list.Samovar Tea Lounge to end this list a place that does not serve coffee at all. Samovar Tea Lounge has three locations in San Francisco (297 Page Street at Laguna, Yerba Buena Gardens at 730 Howard St above the Moscone Center, and 498 Sanchez St in the Castro). Samovar is a place for serious tea and great food. I love coffee but I also am a serious fan of Tea, Samovar has the best tea I have found in San Francisco, served with patience and food that compliments the teas exceptionally well. The Yerba Buena Gardens location is another of my favorite spots for downtown business meetings but also for first dates. It transitions well from a relaxed environment for long conversations and relaxation to a great place for a first date.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other great cafes in San Francisco, cafes with loyal fans, friendly staff, tasty food and beverages but these are the places I return to again and again, the spots I take out of town guests to, the places I plan my day around visiting.source: http://slowbrand.com/2009/06/10/...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 24, 'answer_user': 'Roderick Chow'}, {'answer': 'Both Grove Cafes stay open late and are a good place to work from.There is one on Mission/3rd open till 11 PM every day.

{'qid': 295, 'ans_num': 6, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85When did drip coffee become such a sensation in San Francisco, and why?', 'answers': [{'answer': "(Note: By drip coffee, I'm going to assume you mean the single-cup pour-over, which has become the standard preparation for brewed coffee in many of SF's independent coffeehouses.)The pour-over brewing method favored by Blue Bottle et al. originated in Japan, which is why many of the accouterments you see for sale in San Francisco's coffeehouses bear the brands Hario or Kyocera. In the late 2000s, shops like Blue Bottle began to import brewing methods and equipment from Japan, which lead to a proliferation of pour-over coffee throughout San Francisco (and LA, and Chicago, and Portland, etc.).One adopter \xe2\x80\x94 and importer \xe2\x80\x94 of Japanese gear was James Freeman of Blue Bottle Coffee in Oakland, San Francisco and now Brooklyn.... By 2009, pouring kettles and other gear were stocked by Blue Bottle Coffee and other independent shops like Ritual Coffee Roasters in San Francisco, Intelligentsia in Chicago and Los Angeles and Barismo in Arlington, Mass.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Pour-Over Coffee Wins Converts, NYTHowever, the reason pour-over coffee tastes unfamiliar and unpleasant probably has little to do with the brewing method. As pour-over brewing has become more popular in SF coffeehouses, so has light-roast single-origin coffee. Most familiar supermarket and Starbucks coffees are French- or Italian- style roasts. This means the internal temperature of the coffee bean reaches 240-245 C during roasting, which produces a dark-brown, shiny, low-acidity bean and diminishes much of the origin character of the coffee. Regardless of the beans you start with, the predominant flavors in most dark-roast coffee will be similar. By contrast, independent SF roasters generally roast their beans to an internal temperature of 196 - 210 C, producing a caramel-colored, low-oil, acidic coffee bean which retains many of the characteristic origin flavors of the coffee when brewed. (see Coffee roasting)If you are used to drinking with home-brewed Folgers coffee, or black coffee from Dunkin Donuts, or Italian style espresso beverages, or Viennese coffee, or even pour-over brewed French roast, the light-roast, pour-over drip coffee at Blue Bottle or Ritual is likely to taste foreign, and possibly unpleasant. [Philz is a totally different story (which I won't even address here), and the beverages they serve are practically a different product category than what is served at every other coffee shop I've visited.]Ultimately with matters of food and drink, De gustibus non est disputandum. Just because something is popular, or elite, or well-received by critics doesn't mean that everyone will or needs to enjoy it. The best cup of coffee I've ever had was a latt\xc3\xa9 from a drive through Starbucks on my way home from a 5-day backpacking trip.Pour-over brewing is fundamentally the same method that the ubiquitous $15 Mr. Coffee counter top drip coffee machine employs. Hot water is slowly dripped through a paper cone containing ground coffee. Gravity pulls the water through the grounds, and coffee filters out the bottom of the cone into a vessel such as a cup or carafe. However, the Mr. Coffee has several critical flaws, which pour-over brewing addresses: Brew Temperature: The water that comes out of many electric drippers and into the brew basket is outside the optimal 92-96 C range. Specifically it's too cold - often closer to 70 C. Volume: Most electric dripper brew baskets are too small to accommodate the ideal volume of coffee grounds (~ 55g coffee / 1L of water), especially given the swelling that occurs when the grounds are moistened during brewing. Holding Temperature: Most counter top electric dippers are designed with a glass carafe that sits on top of a hot plate. This essentially burns the coffee after brewing it, by heating it above the recommended holding temperature range of 80-85 C. \xc2\xa0 per Specialty Coffee Association of AmericaEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 37, 'answer_user': 'Peter Rigano'}, {'answer': "Drip coffee is the signature beverage of weak-willed and lily-livered drips, who have taken over a once wild and great city with their incessant gazing and pecking at their palms and fleet of identical candy-coated bi-cycles:The city of San Francisco, the two times it has really mattered to the world, was built by thugs and ruffians and freaks. The first time, it was the sharp-elbowed 49ers who came from nowhere, with nothing, determined to dynamite and hack fortunes out of the ground, along with the whores and gamblers and distillers and opium purveyors who serviced them. They made their damn coffee by throwing a pound of beans into an enamel pot of crick water sitting square in a fire and gargling down the fierce mud that boiled up.The second time, San Francisco got lit by faggots and dykes and the otherwise sexually vibrant and alive and unashamed, along with drug fiends and revolutionaries, all of whom banged up against Irish cops and Italian mobsters and hard-working schoolteachers. They made their coffee by mainlining espresso and having group sex all night before forgetting to ever get a job in the first place and hanging out naked in the sunshine at Golden Gate Park all day.Now San Francisco has been colonized by ironic, precious brunch-goers crawling all over one another to pay $4,000 for a one bedroom apartment where they code 19 hours a day and take Viagra at 25. I'm not surprised that jubilant bohemian celebrator-of-life Kyle Pennell found reasons to absquatulate!

Indeed the lack of the drip in Europe is why there is a Cafe Americana in the first place. You will find one of these in pretty much every coffee drinking home in the United States, this is not a new phenomenon. A pretty large subset of people have these at home because it is ideal for one person. My girlfriend has one, I have the pot above (no really its the exact same white pot, Mr. Coffee is a pretty big deal)What you maybe referring to are coffee housing that use the second option to produce their drip coffee on an individual basis instead of using one of these:It works on the same premise as the other two, just designed to serve more people. These pour over drip houses that have done away with these costly bad boys look something like this:Its all the same basic technology. Like all variations though it requires picking good beans and having the correct grind for the process used. Its different, not better or worse. Espresso is its own thing, if you like that get espresso; there are plenty of good places to get it pretty much anywhere. The great things about living here is you have lots of choice.I think pour over houses have begun to crop up because you have less overhead. Big drip units and espresso machines are very costly up front. This increases the turnaround to profit or makes failure less costly.Another reason I believe this type of production has come to be is the influence of Pho on America. It is common to see coffee produced like so in a Pho establishment:Its drip coffee that is AMAZING and Pho is very popular with folks under 35.So You have:A long history of drip coffee production in the U.S.Pour-over Drip being popularized with younger audiences via PhoYoung entrepreneurs that want to start business but are skiddish about loans in our current economic environment looking for a low barrier to be their own bossIts a perfect storm really.

For my taste, they have the best espresso in the city, rich and creamy and not the slightly-astringent flavor that seems to be so popular these days. The brewed coffee is also amazing, and probably the strongest coffee I have ever had. Rocket fuel. They have pastries and ice cream, which are fine but nothing to write home about. Not trendy, a little touristy, has seating and wifi. (Not near MUNI or BART but walkable)Blue Bottle in the Ferry Terminal Building. Go early, lines get ridiculous after 8am on Saturday (farmer\'s market day at the FTB). Very little seating, so take your coffee and go sit on benches outside and watch the ferries and shoppers. Excellent lattes and cappuccinos, they use whole Clover organic milk by default. And yes, the waffles are amazing. MUNI/BART accessible (Embarcadero)Sightglass Coffee by Civic Center. Trendy. Good espresso and coffee. Cool decor. I imagine it gets very busy, but early morning on a Saturday the people-watching was mostly hospital staff and a couple of other parents.

THESE were the people I knew best. Classical hippie ideals about inner beauty vs. outer beauty were what was taught to me. Due to the lack of demand, there aren't as many high-end stores or large shopping centers here as people would expect. So if a woman did want to change her look, she would have to consciously make an effort to do it. It seems a lot of people on this post don't really like how women from SF look or present themselves, but also remember that a plus side (from my experience) is that many of us SF women are NOT as materialistic and more accepting of different ideas than many women in LA. For example, someone like me is more open to the idea of accepting a nerdy, artistic, flamboyant, talkative, quiet, unique, or alternative guy than a woman from LA would be and just about every woman I know from this area is the same. Considering the fact that LA is home to Hollywood, every time I visit it, I expect that people want to be glamorous and focus on their looks more.

There are many differences between people in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I believe it is due to the differences in the cities. This reply contains gross generalizations but I believe them to be roughly true and I believe they affect how people (and women) live their lives in each city. Many of these generalizations are about people between 20 and 35 as I spend the most time with them. Full disclosure: I was raised in a wealthier community in Los Angeles and as a result my position on the matter may be skewed.Many jobs in Los Angeles are in entertainment. My friends are actors, PAs, editors, camera men, riggers, and musicians. Their parents are directors, producers, actors, musicians, record execs, etc. Even people in tech in Los Angeles are involved in entertainment - they create video editing software, they run digital post productions houses, etc. They are less stressed out and more laid back than San Franciscans as their jobs often don't allow them to work a single 60-80 hour a week desk job. Many people in LA (and the entertainment business) get where they are through networking, persistence, luck, and working their way up the chain. LA is also far more ethnically diverse residents. There are significant Jewish, Korean, Chinese, Persian, Mexican, and other populations within LA. Neighborhoods also contain many children/grandparents/families in Los Angeles. LA is also far more affordable to live in and has a huge range housing costs and there is often more class diversity. People in LA are often judged by what they look like, who they are, what kind of car they drive, and who they know.Most of the women I know in the bay area are developers, project managers, salespeople, account managers, recruiters, and the like. They work in finance, technology, and creative spaces. They are often extremely ambitious and career oriented and many of them get where they are through 60 hour work weeks behind a desk. SF seems much less culturally, politically, and financially diverse than LA. That said, one can find many diverse ethnic populations by leaving SF proper and heading to Oakland, Daly City, San Jose, Milpitas, and many other nearby neighborhoods. SF has a higher cost of living than LA which seems to result in more homogenous middle-to-upper class citizens. San Francisco has far fewer K-12 students and senior citizens. San Franciscans are typically more tech oriented in general. People in SF are often judged by their careers and business successes.I find women in San Francisco to be more into technology, more progressive, more interested in politics, less religious, and more ambitious.I find women in Los Angeles to be more diverse politically, more into fashion and style, more on top of television and the latest cultural trends, more laid back, and have much larger diversity in their career choices and incomes.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 37, 'answer_user': 'Michael Margolis'}, {'answer': "I lived in LA (West Hollywood/Beverly Hills) for 7+ years working in fashion and entertainment PR before moving up to SF a few months ago.

When I was interviewing for jobs in SF, I was told by a resident friend that dressing like that would make me look out of place and weird. (He was right -- the office was full of jeans and sneakers!) The SF-y laid-back attitude definitely translates into the way women up here dress. For example, I had never seen a woman in a pair of TOMS shoes until moving to SF -- practically every woman up here owns a pair! But I have yet to see a woman in Louboutins or even carrying a Louis Vuitton handbag (which is the unofficial uniform down in LA, I swear).

The problem up here is as much total failure to know good style as much as it is the lack of effort. Basically, nearly everyone in LA looks better then nearly everyone in SF - even in jeans and t-shirts. That is not why I prefer the LA Ladies tho - it's that SF women are among the most dogmatic and judgmental self selected population I've ever encountered. Everyone in LA is hustling, trying to find new ways to make it, etc. Here is SF, everyone seems convinced they have already made it - Ivy League degree in hand, they are competing for Social Worker jobs in Oakland (to save those less 'privileged' than themselves) and need the just right guy to shoe horn into their Life Plans. LA women, and given the significantly larger population, they are much much more varied as a group, seem much more focused on what they want to do as opposed to what they have to prove, and seem more open to seeing where a relationship takes them as opposed to whether or not it fits into a preconceived notion of how things 'should' be.SF women are, on average, 'smarter' and more well read, far more educated, but lack the sense of humor and open mindedness the LA women have. In SF it always feels like people are trying to fit into each other's perfect life plans, where as in LA everyone is trying to figure out how to survive and make tomorrow a little better and more interesting - looking to find the next great thing as opposed to feeling like they have to prove that they have already built the best thing.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 40, 'answer_user': 'David Kaye'}, {'answer': 'I\'m a L.A. girl but am going to answer this anonymously because I know I\'ll be every kind of vapid bitch in the book after this - but I\'m also telling the truth according to how I see it.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s my L.A. and S.F. connection: I\'m from L.A., I went to Stanford, I lived in SF after undergrad and now I\'m in graduate school in L.A.\xc2\xa0 My ex-boyfriend (who does live in SF) would say that the women in SF dress like men, they don\'t groom or take care of themselves, they dress like they\'re depressed, they don\'t wear heels, etc etc. I used to think it was just Palo Alto, but that whole "I\'m busy doing shit" look extends to S.F. as well. In all honesty, I\'m like a lot of in shape women with a fairly symmetrical face: on any given make-up free day, I\'m a 6 or a 7. With a lot of effort, I can pull it up to a 9. With a professional team, I can make it to an 11. Most women can do this. Most women, with some effort can land in the 7-9 range by doing something as simple as grooming their eyebrows, painting their nails, wearing something fitted and getting a really good haircut that complements their facial structure. The biggest difference in L.A. and S.F. women is that L.A. women know that it\'s possibly to look like a 10 or even better. I don\'t believe that S.F. women really believe it. I feel like they\'re kind of stuck in the 5-7 range and anything above that which requires effort is "being fake". Perception is reality.Women in S.F. also take their degrees and their careers way too seriously. I mean, I get it - be proud of it. I\'m really proud of mine too. But degrees do not keep you warm at night. I speak two languages, have traveled all over the world and went to a great school with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Spanish. I rarely mention any of that in initial conversation. I mean, it\'s a part of who I am, so it\'s going to come up, but I don\'t feel like I have to prove that Im a really smart or ambitious person. From my time in SF, it seemed to me that a lot of women felt that they had to prove that they were just as smart as men. And I totally get that there\'s that whole "women can\'t code" attitude in some spaces and that has a lot to do with it. In L.A., because the industries are much more diverse and the dominant industry in town (Hollywood) has plenty of women in positions of power, I don\'t feel that women in L.A. feel that they have to walk into a room proving anything. When I lived in SF, I was turning down dates left and right. I had my pick. It\'s amazing what you can accomplish when instead of wearing Converse sneakers to the latest launch party, you decide to wear some heels. Or hell, even some wedges. And hoodies are best left to Mark Zuckerberg. Women in SF wear them all the time and most women in L.A. wouldn\'t be caught dead wearing one out socially, for real. It\'s like, "What\'s the point of slaving over the treadmill if I\'m just going to cover it all up?" I get that SF gets cold. Invest in a nice and tailored blazer and a cute scarf though. Because most of your competition, other SF women, look like they raided their little brother\'s closet, by just dressing with a little feminine effort, you can blow a good 85% of your competition out of the water. If you are a well groomed, well put together woman (hetero or homosexual) in SF, the dating pool is your oyster. Another thing. My ex was way too impressed that I got Brazilians, my hair blown out and my nails and toes done regularly. In L.A., that\'s standard. No man here has ever been impressed by that. In fact, there are men in L.A. that won\'t even date a woman if she doesn\'t do those things. Men in S.F. were genuinely, deeply impressed by this. My ex (we\'re really good friends now) actively complains that he has not had a girlfriend in SF since that regularly waxed or got regular blow outs. I hear a lot of SF women say that they don\'t have time do this stuff, but that\'s why God invented Dry Bar. (Drybar, The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Premier Blow Out Salon and Blow Dry Bar) L.A. women are total devotees.\xc2\xa0 I know this sounds like I\'m about to set the women\'s movement back a good 60 years, but there\'s an enormous power in the vagina and a great way to maximize that "sphere of influence" (but certainly not the only way) is to keep it interesting down there. In L.A., there are tons of waxing, sugaring, laser and trimming options to try and experiment with. Good sex and good visuals can\'t make a relationship last, but I\'ll be damned if it doesn\'t go a very long way, especially when a guy knows that he can\'t just go out anywhere and find a girl that\'s willing to do all of that. Women that don\'t consistently groom are leaving power on the table. Lean in ladies, lean in. I\'ve also heard women in S.F. just don\'t get the concept of lingerie. American women in general have a problem with this, but I think women in L.A. do better than most in this department. I think women in L.A. better understand that men are visual creatures and my girlfriends in L.A. really understand this. We actively talk about lingerie, who is having a sale, the thongs at Target versus Cosa Bella, etc etc. I never had those conversations in S.F. with any of my girlfriends. I honestly felt like an idiot having an extended conversation about it. Women in L.A., by and large don\'t see La Perla, Agent Provocateur and Eberjey as being a waste of money; they see it as an investment. If you feel sexy, you exude sex appeal and confidence, which people pick up on. I don\'t think S.F. women have gotten the memo on the ROI of lingerie. Women in L.A., the ones that haven\'t piled their faces with Botox and Mac foundation understand that the "natural" look really isn\'t that natural. Some women in L.A. have a lot of time to go all into it - the concealer, the eyelash curling, etc etc. Women in S.F. are too busy for that and I think every day, it\'s kind of a waste. But, I do think that a lot of women in S.F. take the "natural" look too literally - by actually going natural. The natural look really isn\'t natural at all; it\'s a subtle blush (usually Orgasm by NARS) or bronzer, mascara, lip gloss and if you\'re feeling really jazzy, a brush of eye shadow. A lot of sun kissed, yogis in L.A. that have that fresh bikram glow really just have a very well (read: discreetly) painted face. This may sound like I\'m hating on SF women. I\'m not. Without question, SF has the smartest consolidation of women on the West Coast and I love that women in SF really help other women and take that mission to heart. It\'s definitely not like that in L.A. The women in the City by the Bay that I\'ve met in school, work and just living in the city are some of the funniest, smartest women that are into the most random (in a good way) things and interests. The men in SF should be so lucky to have them. I just think there are a few things, visually, that women in SF could do to better market their awesomeness. I know that women in L.A. get a reputation for not being that smart, but in the visual and dating department, I definitely think the ladies up North could learn a thing or two from the ladies down South.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 111, 'answer_user': 'Renat Aksitov'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2013, 9, 9, 7, 4), 'tag': ['Los Angeles vs. San Francisco', 'Comparing Cities', 'Los Angeles, CA', 'San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Francisco', 'Women', 'Dating and Relationships'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

I\'ve visited both. I live in the South Bay, Silicon Valley. (Psst... there\'s stuff to see here, too, but you may require transportation that is not the public sort, and a bit of digging, to see it.) Other caveat: I\'m not a big-city person. My suburban existence gets punctuated by trips to more rural areas of California at least as often as by trips to the city. Before we begin, a public service announcement about SF Bay Area weatherI took this photo of the Golden Gate Bridge (and Civil War era Fort Point, underneath it, which I also recommend visiting) in June. It\'s probably about 15C here. Even if the peninsula or inland valleys are sweltering in summer\'s heat, you will want at least a light jacket for SF and the coast. The gift shop makes much of its money selling sweatshirts to chilly tourists who have heard of "sunny California." That cloudless panorama you have seen of this same bridge was most likely taken in November or February. The SF Bay Area is a very diverse place, and as such doesn\'t summarize well. I live here, and I suspect I\'m biased a little towards here. We have nature and arts, high tech and history. Our oldest structure in town, whether north or south, is apt to be the mission established by the Spanish in the 1700-1800s. El Camino Real connects the missions, built at intervals of about 20 miles, to be a day\'s journey apart. Of course, those missions were generally constructed by the native populations that were here first, but it\'s worth seeing some original adobe, if you visit. (This is at Mission Santa Clara de As\xc3\xads.)For nature, if you are so inclined, see if you can get yourself north of San Francisco, into the Marin Headlands or up to Muir Woods or Mount Tamalpais. Or, head south to Santa Cruz and take in the redwoods in Henry Cowell park. There are numerous lesser known parks around and between. From some of the peaks in the Russian Ridge (midway along the peninsula) you can see most of the bay on a clear day.I am not the right person to comment on bars and night life, but I am told both exist, particularly in the city. Certainly both San Francisco and San Jose have art galleries and museums of various sorts, plus a wide assortment of shopping, from gigantic shiny malls to quirky used bookstores. Tech is harder to see unless you\'re looking for it. Most of the tech firms don\'t really invite visitors. Intel may be an exception, with a free museum at their Santa Clara facility. Apple does have a store at One Infinite Loop in Cupertino. Otherwise, if you wish to see Google or Yahoo! or eBay or what-have-you, the most you\'re likely to get is a photo of the outside of the building and the sign. One better choice is the Computer History Museum in Mountain View (about 45 minutes\' drive south of San Francisco). If you\'re there, you may want to stop at the NASA Ames visitor center, too. (Big hint: ask questions and get the volunteer docents talking.) See Which places should a technophile visit on a trip to San Francisco and Silicon Valley? for vastly more information.I\'ll plug just a couple of my other favorite places to visit. Both are in Alameda, in the East Bay. One is the Aircraft Carrier USS Hornet Museum. It\'s an entire aircraft carrier, now docked. Allow a full day, if you go. It\'s basically a floating city, and the flight decks and many of the public nooks and crannies feature museum exhibits on various themes. There\'s even an Apollo space capsule. The other is the Pacific Pinball Museum, which is exactly what it sounds like. The admission fee lets you stay and play all but the oldest and feeblest couple of something like 90 pinball machines, from the very early days to the present. The LA area also isn\'t just Los Angeles, but a sprawl of city and suburbs. If you go, be sure to see the Getty Center (either/both of them) and the Huntington, unless you have no interest in anything museum-like. Disneyland, too, if you are so inclined. I also enjoyed the La Brea tar pits and the nearby Peterson Automotive Museum (which features, among other things, several famous movie cars). There are certainly other landmarks and places to visit, but I am not so familiar with that area. These are just the ones that stick out in my mind.As Garrick says, the two are not so far apart, and a short flight will get you from one to the other.

Dating in LA is like the city itself: fake. People date each other for a reason--because they want something from you, be it money, drugs, fame, sex, or status. Then again, dating in LA can be fun because there are no feelings involved. Being single in LA can also be fun because it's a very self-centered subculture. People are more adventurous and since you're dealing with a more attractive population, you have to work harder to look better, which can do wonders for your self-esteem (of course, it can also have the opposite effect if you waste your time trying to compare yourself to women who are supernatural). I've never dressed, looked, or felt better than when I lived in LA. Also, I never felt bad about being single in LA because I could tell that 99% of relationships around me were also fake. I actually felt like I was the only one living in reality and being true to myself by being by myself and making myself happy.Being single in SF, on the other hand, is a little more difficult in terms of jealousy over others' relationships. Here, I've seen genuine relationships develop--not based on looks and fame but more on intellect and genuine happiness. Living in SF, I could let my eyebrows grow out, wear less makeup, put on a couple of pounds, and wear North Face jackets everywhere, and I'd still get asked out (doing any of this in LA might imply that I was homeless). That's not to say that there isn't a fair amount of status-seeking in SF; after all, people are smarter here. True story.Being in a relationship in SF is pure bliss. The weather is colder, which is conducive to snuggling up. And, because people are generally bundled up, showing skin is actually a rare commodity around here (in other words, it will definitely get you noticed, assuming you're remotely attractive and not one of those weird hippies who runs around naked anyway). People are generally more fit around here versus simply anorexic, so adventure abounds. Conversations tend to be more intellectual, which is a nice contrast to the superficial LA vernacular.

Here are a few notes:-Virgin America and United both use SFO as a hub, so will probably have the highest volume of flights available (JetBlue also has a high volume of flights, but it's technically not a hub for them, and I haven't flown with them in a while)-United flies a special service called p.s. (SFO-JFK and LAX-JFK only), which is a full three-class aircraft (including the only first class lie-flat beds on US domestic routes). All economy seats are 'Economy Plus' and come with wifi/power in the seats. Try to avoid any United flights that are not designated 'p.s.' (i.e. any indirect flights, or flights to EWR), because they will not have wifi/power, and the seats will be extraordinarily cramped :(-I haven't flown Delta on this route, but I can tell you Virgin America has notably better service than any other airline I've flown on this route, and you can't beat the consistency of their amenities (you should expect every Virgin flight to have wifi, in-seat power, good service, leather seats, personal media screens, decent food options)-Virgin America's personal media screens are very unique in the industry, if entertainment is a priority. They have a great selection of on-demand music (free), TV (live: free, on-demand: $) and films ($) on personal touchscreens, which you can also use to order food.-Virgin now has a mileage redemption partnership with Virgin Atlantic, so you finally have some other options for earning miles with an international airline network.-If you are trying to upgrade on your flight, Virgin also has a unique option. If First Class is not sold out six hours before the flight, you can upgrade from Main Cabin (economy) for $299 (*updated price as of late 2011). I don't know of any other airline that offers this. Conversely, however, frequent fliers do not get automatically bumped up to First, as far as I know.I unequivocally recommend Virgin America if you can find a decent fare (they usually have good fares with advanced purchase), but you will certainly want to take into account the broader frequent flier and culture questions.

I myself fly Delta and am usually happy with it. Features:All the airlines (except JetBlue) flying this route have in-flight WiFi. Delta and Virgin America have in-seat power and personal TVs with TV and movies as well. On a pure features perspective Delta and Virgin America win out.Legroom/comfort:United and JetBlue have the most legroom, at around 34" each. This can make a big difference for some people on long trips.Network/FF Program:If you\'ll be flying many other routes/international routes as well, the network size and frequent flyer program can be important. A good FF program will get you upgraded into first class pretty regularly. Any of the three legacy carriers (United, Delta, American) will have excellent networks for lots of other flights. Consensus tends to be that United and American have slightly better Frequent Flier programs, but I actually find I get upgraded to first on Delta pretty regularly (I\'m a Gold, the mid-tier). If you do this route a lot, American will let you get to Platinum fast through their Platinum Challenge.Customer Service/In-flight Staff:You\'ll find examples of terrible service on all the airlines, but generally the staff is better on the newer airlines, namely JetBlue and Virgin America. Also, United is the only service to offer meal service on the flight, if that\'s important to you.It\'s also worth noting that Virgin America has gone for a very cool/hip/sexy feel, which makes the flight feel a little like a nightclub.

This is to make sure that it is able to safely withstand the stresses due to the weight of the engines attached on the wings. Even the fuel tank in the larger wet-wing type planes is embedded in the wings. The over wing exits provide you with a fast way to deplane during an emergency. The wing structure also saves you during a crash by absorbing a part of the impact energy due to progressive buckling. With all these arguments in mind, I always choose a seat near the wings when I fly and suggest you to do the same.

I think the drawback is they\'re picking up other people at those hours and you end up having to leave your house way too early. :(The cab ride for a 6am flight would pick you up around 4:40am. It\'ll run you about $32 bucks plus tip. (I live near 500 Club so that\'s pretty close to you.) I think this is reasonable, since for about $15 more you get a much more reliable service than a "friend," and it gets you to the airport pretty quickly (about 20-25 minutes). If you have taken cabs in LA, you will be thankful for a $32 cab fare. Uber - about $60. If this is an expensable situation, or if you don\'t mind the extra cost then this is (sort of) worth it. Otherwise not really.Task Rabbit - you can post this request and set your own price.

You can probably make it to the airport in time for a 6am flight, but you are cutting it close. American Airporter is another good alternative. Lorries Airport Shuttle is the local GO Brand and is another good option.SuperShuttle generally gets bad reviews because they cart you all over the entire city at times. If you pick a provider like Airport Express SF, which does not serve the Sunset or Richmond neighborhoods, or anything west of the Presidio, you are much less likely to be carted around the city on your way to the airport.

They even have services that they are planning on attaching like having a warm meal for you in the car so you can avoid airport food. They claim to be able to satisfy any time of the day, so that is a good option for early rides, and unlike other rideshare services like UberX, Sidecar and Lyft, Tickengo specializes in airports and takes advanced reservations.Another option is Flightcar (http://www.flightcar.com), which allows you to drive your car to the airport, park it there for free, and make money by letting them rent out your car.

I admit this is an improbable situation, because there are two pilots (at least for now), and I do not imagine any situation that one of them, even very sick, would not prefer to try to land the plane by him/herself than to handle it over to a passenger, but, let us imagine, for the sake of the answer, that you, a passenger, decide to go for it. So, you enter the cockpit, pilots are nowhere to be seen, you sit on the left seat (pilot in command), all the lights are green (if not, forget about a safe end of your trip) and all the passengers and the rest of the crew are cheering at you.Well, you need first to identify the primary instrumentsIt seems complex.. this is and old fashioned (and rather battered) DC9 cockpit, now cockpits are digital, some of them still have analog instruments, some of them have all the analog instruments replaced by a single screen, the "primary flight display indicator", which concentrates all the information you need and I refer to later, on a single instrumentYou, the non-pilot sitting on the left seat, need to start doing something to land safelySo let us start indentifying the radioThe radio is located on a commercial plane on the pedestal, which is the central panel, in between pilot and copilot. It is usually labelled Comm (unless you are on a soviet plane, of course). You should identify the frequency (it should show something between 108 and 136... this is the civil aviation band frequency). You locate a microphone (hanging somewhere), you press the button (do not forget to press to talk) or you locate on the yoke a button labelled transmit (the yoke is the funny horned thing in front of you) and you say: "mayday, mayday, this is (put here the letters and numbers that are clearly labelled in front of you, on a kind of sheet of metal, in this case A/C 9760), mayday". Either you have a response or not. If not, you should find on the radio set how to change the frequency and set it to 121.5 which is the emergency frequency all the aircraft community is hearing and repeat your distress call. You say that you are a non pilot, and you follow their instructions...They will ask you to locate theseOf course they will not look exactly the same (1 will be different, 4 will be (probably) hidden somewhere, but to locate 1 (it is the most important, the airspeed indicator), you must find it, usually it says "knots" somewhere, unless, of course, if the aircraft is built in Russia, or it is a sailplane. But, let us continue. On the airspeed indicator there is a "safe" zone (green or labelled differently). While you are in it, your speed is OK. Then you should locate 6, it is called the "variometer" and it tells you if your aircraft goes up or down (or, hopefully, stays levell). You will recognize it because the needle 0 position is at 9 or 3 (and probably it says "up" and "down" nearby). You did\'nt touch anything yet, did you? If the plane has a FDI (Flight display indicator) the same information should appear on it (attitude, airspeed, altitude, variometer)Finally, to flight your plane, you still need to know something about 2 or 4. 2 is called "attitude indicator" or "artificial horizon", 4 "Turn coordinator", 4 seems to be kept for sentimental reasons and / or old fashioned pilots :). Those are the most counterintuitive instruments, because an aircraft is not like a car. On a car, if you change direction on the front wheels, the car turns, if you descend a hill, the front of the car is lower than the rear. A plane may descend while it remains perfectly horizontal, or even in a "nose up" attitude. Or it may go forward on a straight line while the tail is off-center and the plane banks... so, you need to have the attitude indicator "centered" (you will see some kind of fixed mark - on 2, the big red arrow - tied to the aircraft and an moving part, half in blue, like the sky, and half in brown, like the ground.Hopefully, air controllers have you already on their radar, so they know where you are, and what altitude are you flying. With the indicators 1, 3, 4 and 6 you should be able to fly a plane (if you recognize your surroundings, of course, if not, you should add a compass (5) and a watch)Air controllers will probably ask you what course you follow. This will be provided by the compass, this is an indicator labelled between 0 and 33,\xc2\xa0 usually in increments of 3, and probably with N, E, S and W. Do not expect to find N or 0 on the 12 clock position, because sometimes (like in 6) the compass moves, and 0 clock position gives you the course. And sometimes North is at 12, and a needle shows your course.And then, probably you should take the yoke, put your feet on the two pedals, and - following instructions - although by now, two or three fighters will be flying near you, with their finger at the trigger - disconnect the autopilot, cross your fingers, and start aiming to the most suitable airport (the one with the longest and widest runway, on the same course you follow).Good luck!Embed QuoteVia  Santosh Desiraju.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Carlos Griell Ventosa'}, {'answer': 'The safest way to crash land is straight ahead.

Note that people who have to helped on to the wheelchair have to wait till all the passengers offload. Therefore if the passenger can walk even a bit, they should exit with the rest of the passengers and locate the attendants outside to save a bunch of time. Her bags were unloaded fairly early. She identified her 2 bags and a second staff member loaded them on a trolley and escorted her to Customs.\xc2\xa0 On my Mom\'s request the first staffer placed a call on the staffers cell phone to my friend who was waiting outside. She asked if my friend would like to escort my mom but she asked they stick to the plan.\xc2\xa0 It was agreed that the staff member would take my mom from the International terminal to T3 and my friend may or may not get an opportunity to spot her at the domestic security checkpoints for United gates there.

(This makes me sad) The common public transit solution for this is taking BART from the airport to the Millbrae Intermodal Terminal. The only BART-Caltrain direct connection is at Millbrae. If you're heading north into San Francisco, I recommend just taking BART (it depends on where you're going, but there's few places I'd recommend transferring from BART to Caltrain to head to San Francisco).Before about 7pm on work weekdays, you need to take BART north from SFO to San Bruno, and then south from San Bruno to Millbrae. This should take about 15 minutes. Trains run about every 15 minutes.After about 7pm on weekdays, on weekends, and holidays, you can take BART from SFO directly to Millbrae. This should take about 4 minutes, and trains run every 15 - 20 minutes.The map should explain why there is this sillyness http://bart.gov/stations/index.aspxEither way, it's $4.05. At Millbrae, if you're heading south on Caltrain, you will walk upstairs, exit BART, then walk to the southbound platform. If you're heading to a northbound Caltrain, you'll probably just be able to walk across the platform.There are other options, depending on where you're going (if you aren't wedded to Caltrain).

Every beyond-perimeter route has to be approved by the DOT. There were some changes as part of the FAA reauthorization that Obama signed into law in February.Four incumbent airlines were allowed to swap a within perimeter route for a beyond perimeter route.

{'qid': 377, 'ans_num': 4, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why is San Francisco International Airport abbreviated as SFO?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'Most airports in the US have a three-letter International Air Transport Association (IATA, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAT...) code, which is an identifier used to refer to the airport in online booking and consumer-facing operations. These codes don\'t often end in I (for International) or A (for Airport) because most codes would be entitled to end that way and it would leave us fewer codes to use [see below for some exceptions]. Instead, a system of abbreviations similar to postal abbreviations for US states has been developed, where the final letter of a name can be used in its abbreviation. So I suspect the O in SFO comes from the final letter of \'San Francisco\'. The pages linked to below refer to many examples where letters throughout the airport name (not necessarily letters near the beginnings of words) are used in the abbreviation. One example is EWR for Newark.Nevertheless, there are exceptions to the rule of "no I\'s or A\'s to mean the obvious things". The original code for Dulles International Airport outside of DC was DIA, but that was too easy to confuse with the nearby DCA, especially when the codes were handwritten, so the code was changed to the current, somewhat unintuitive, IAD. [ http://www.skygod.com/asstd/abc.... ] DCA [DC Airport] and BWI [Baltimore Washington International] also seem to be exceptions to the regularity.Some IATA codes have interesting etymologies. Chicago\'s O\'Hare International, formerly the busiest airport in the world, is ORD, because "before the\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 editor and publisher of the Chicago Tribune, Colonel Robert McCormick\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 suggested a name change as tribute to pilot Lt.

[http://www.skygod.com/asstd/abc.... ].You might wonder why San Jose International is SJC and not SJO or SJE. In that case, the reason is that SJO was taken by San Jose, Costa Rica. The C in SJC seems to be for California, though that is only a guess [ http://airportcitycodes.com/code... -- this link, like the other, contains a lot of code history].There also exist codes for regions with multiple airports -- e.g. LON for all of the London-area airports (Heathrow LHR, Gatwick LGW, Stanstead STN, Biggin Hill BQH, Luton LTN, and London City LCY) and NYC (JFK, LGA, EWR).Internally to the aviation industry (e.g. aeronautical charts), ICAO identifiers are more commonly used.\xc2\xa0 These are 4-character identifiers, assigned regionally.\xc2\xa0 In many cases, mainland US ICAO codes are the IATA identifier prefixed with K, e.g. SFO is KSFO and PAO (Palo Alto) is KPAO.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 60, 'answer_user': 'Ben Golub'}, {'answer': 'The abbreviations originated with railroad telegraphers and dispatchers whose communications served to prevent scheduling conflicts and disastrous accidents.\xc2\xa0 Three-letter abbreviations were necessary from the earliest days to avoid such confusions as SF: Santa Fe or San Francisco.The abbreviations were adopted by early pilots who wanted/needed not to disappear unnoticed if they went down enroute.\xc2\xa0 Early pilots tended to navigate by following railroads anyway, and the telegraph system was almost always associated with those routes.When aeronautical flight planning and flight-following systems (formal arrangements that succeeded the individual air mail pilot\'s dropping by the telegraph offiice before takeoff) were adopted, the US Civil Aeronautics Administration\'s maps showed the airport locations, labeled with the abbreviation, and its spatial relationship to the city or town.\xc2\xa0 Abbreviations ending in A\xc2\xa0 were parts of the location name, since all of the locations were an airport, airfield or airdrome.When international commercial air transport services were initiated, the first international cooperation arrangements were put in place.\xc2\xa0 Aircraft radio "stations" were seen as just another type of radio stations, and their call-sign indicators were regulated by the international telecommunications conventions, which allocated initial letters as an identifier of nationality.\xc2\xa0 The CAA and other aeronautical authorities agreed that aircraft registrations would use the radio callsign, which is why US aircraft use N-numbers and [Great] Britain\'s registry numbers start with G-, etc.\xc2\xa0 The Aviation Fixed Telecommunications Network, established to send safety messages and flight plans, adopted standard format messages using the "four-letter" airport identifiers mentioned by Ben Golub, and these identifiers use the initial nationality or region indicator as well.\xc2\xa0 US radio call signs can start with N, A, K or W, so four-letter airfield designators start with K.\xc2\xa0 Exceptions are airfields in Hawaii, whose four-letter airport codes start with P, designating Pacific Region.The Canadian airports\' four-letter designators start with C, for Canadian Region, and the three-letter suffix matches the three-letter Y?? airport designator that was originally assigned by the UK CAA when it administered Canadian aeronautical facilities.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Jim Gordon'}, {'answer': 'Because it serves the entire SF / Oakland region.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Marc Hoag'}, {'answer': "A very simple way to decifer the airport codes, is you'd need to know the names of many of them to get it.\xc2\xa0 In Canada all airport codes start with Y and have only a coincidental relevance to the city they serve.\xc2\xa0 YYC - Calgary, YVR - Vancouver, YYZ - Toronto...The rest of the world has a seemingly more logical approach, though, as some\xc2\xa0 posters noted with many codes taken and can't be repeated, some make more sense than others.\xc2\xa0 Also as city names change, the codes won't, for ease of everything.\xc2\xa0 See BOM - Mumbai (formerly Bombay), SGN - Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).\xc2\xa0 Many make sense if you give it a quick thought, SFO is a good example, LAX another, AMS...take your best shot.At the end of the day there's no perfect answer beyond the fact that everytime an airport is opened it needs a 3 letter code, as more open we run out of options, some make sense, BOS - Boston some don't TXL - Berlin Tegel.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Brett Armstrong'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2010, 7, 24, 15, 55), 'tag': ['San Francisco International Airport (SFO)', 'How Did X Geographical Location Get Its Name?', 'Abbreviations', 'Airports', 'Etymology'], 'question_user': 'Ben Golub'}

Landing fees at SFO are based on weight, with a minimum landing fee of $127 (http://www.flysfo.com/web/page/d...).You would be parking at the only FBO, Signature Flight Support, so you wouldn\'t pay any terminal fees, however parking at Signature is likely to be just as expensive. Usually though, you get a discount or free parking for the first night for buying a minimum amount of fuel ($6.49/gal at Signature compared with $5.10/gal at San Carlos airport).ATC will let you land at SFO (the only restriction is that student pilots must have an endorsement from their instructor to fly into the "class Bravo" airspace), but they will likely make you hold or give you delay vectors until there is a break in traffic where they can bring you in without impeding following traffic. A 172 can easily approach at 90 or 100kts, then bring in full flaps and slow to 65kts about 200ft above the runway for landing (I do this all the time with instrument approaches). A 747 can slow down to 125kts with 30 degrees of flaps and gear down, so ATC can work these things out.With San Carlos airport (SQL) so close, the only reason to land at SFO is to say you did. The taxi time alone would discount any advantage of being closer to the city.While, I\'ve never landed at SFO, I was previously based at HOU - Houston Hobby (a busy class Bravo airport) and flown into MSY - New Orleans International, and CLT - Charlotte/Douglas International.Below is a video of a trip into CLT:Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 19, 'answer_user': 'Andrew Stagg'}, {'answer': 'I took a tour of SFO Tower a while ago, and they said that there was someone operating a Cessna 182 out of the airport, and that it\'s pilot had gotten accustomed to the issues of operating out of such a busy environment.The main difficulty would be being prepared enough.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how they would assign a pattern entry or merge you in with existing traffic, and there are no notes on this on the airport guide that I use.\xc2\xa0 My guide does say that pilots are encouraged to request a long landing for the 28 runways so that\xc2\xa0 they can touch down west of "The Ones" (1L and 1R) to minimise the taxi time to the FBO (Signature Flight Support).\xc2\xa0 When doing this there is an issue with jet blast and wake turbulence from aircraft taking off on 1L and 1R, as well as through all aspects of taxi, run-up and subsequent takeoff.It\'s a good idea to talk to the tower ahead of time in order to work out a schedule that won\'t put you in conflict with a lot of commercial traffic.\xc2\xa0 SFO has busy and quiet times, which are set up to facilitate transfers for airlines that hub there, so it can make a big difference when you come in.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes the airspace is busy enough that they won\'t even allow traffic to transition north or south through the Bravo airspace.

Also ORD\'s terminals are dirty, noisy, seriously lacking power outlets and near-impossible to sleep in (I slept overnight there for 5hrs once, it made sleeping on the floor of JFK T3 seem like the Hilton, honest). The terminal staff have a screw-you attitude. Traffic to/from ORD sucks, and it is impossible to drive or transfer ORD-MDW in a deterministic amount of time (for a connection), it\'s more reliable to simply fly all the way to New York or wherever.ORD is a notoriously crappy city for delays and cancellations due to both weather and air traffic (#4 on 11 Worst US Airports for Layovers).

Why?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'First of all, the number of flights at many airports is actually increasing over the past few years, so it is probably incorrect to say that "there are decreases in the rest of the country." The airport in Milwaukee, as an example, has seen an increase of 130% in passenger traffic from 2010 to 2011. Still, airport traffic rises and falls over time because airlines go out of business, consolidate flights due to mergers or increase traffic due to demand. Of course, one cannot compare the size of the Milwaukee airport to that of San Francisco.My friend David Litwak\'s answer seems to have logic to it but I am not entirely sure that is the whole story. If there are so many top tech companies located in the area and in Silicon Valley, then how come the airport at San Jose (SJC), located right in Silicon Valley has only seen modest changes (1.3%) in passenger traffic? The logic says it should be booming, but it isn\'t.

The link below has pictures of the devices. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/bl...The rule is that if you're in a lane with the strip search machine and you choose to opt out, then you get punished by being groped.

I was flying back from Kauai and there were two lanes side by side. The metal detector lane moved much faster than the strip search lane, yet people would go through both.This huge difference also illustrates how this is all for show. If there were a true threat that these procedures prevented, all metal detector only lanes should require the enhanced pat downs. Given the interconnectedness of our airport system, all you have to do is find the weakest link. (Although Boston Logan gets a lot of the blame for 9/11, several of the hijackers connected from another airport.)An alternative, for those who want to challenge the system, is to go through the pat down and file an assault complaint.

It is nicer than the international terminal, which is saying something, and there is no comparison to T1 or T3. The entry hall is sunlight down from a high ceiling. The check in areas are wood-paneled, which gives the check in process a less adversarial feeling. Virgin America\'s, in particular, use low tables instead of high counters, and contemporary computer equipment with design-conscious finishes, to project friendliness during what is often a stressful experience. Security is security. It\'s cleaner, but not otherwise different from other terminals. Post-security is where things get truly nice. You enter a wide, well-light "recompose area" with long couches you can use to put your shoes back on etc. If you look up there\'s a fun piece of art meant to evoke the sky (and, I think, fishing nets). Then as you work your way down towards the gates you notice two things: 1. "wow, this place is really clean, wide, high-ceilinged and sunlit for an airport", and 2. "these are some of the nicest airport concessions I\'ve seen". If the most downmarket food concessions at your terminal are Andale and Pinkberry, you\'re doing well. At the top of the range there\'s a branch of the Plant Cafe Organic, a Lark Creek Grill and something called Napa Farms Market, which I think is grab-and-go food, but whose design is supposed to evoke the Ferry Building (really!) OK, it\'s not the French Laundry, but this is an airport... There\'s even a "hydration station" where you can fill your empty bottle post-security with filtered water.The gate areas have high quality seats, including several Jacobsen egg chairs. There are rows of laptop tables and literally hundreds of power sockets to satisfy the average bay area resident\'s gadget-charging needs. The gate numbering is a bit odd. They have 14 gates and had to squeeze them in between T1 and T3\'s existing gate numbers, so there are 3 gates designated 54: 54A, 54B and 54C. The exterior of the building is great too. The two wings of the building are decorated with massive pixellated murals. The whole thing was built with sustainability in mind. I think it will be the first LEED Gold-certified airport terminal in the country. Instead of climate control ducts the walls "breathe" (if you get close to the metal panels on the walls you can see that they\'re perforated). The only meh part is baggage claim. There was apparently no way to make it radically different from the original 1950s design, so the ceilings are low, and it feels a lot like T1. But it is at least clean, brightly painted and so on.

{'qid': 392, 'ans_num': 2, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why does BART charge $4 more for a ride to SFO than to Millbrae from any point in the system?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'The $4 surcharge to go to the SFO BART station was part of BART\'s system-wide fare increases in 2009 that included a 6% overall fare increase [1]. The idea was that it was a good way to increase revenue without affecting daily commuters. BART\'s passenger fares cover over 50 percent of their operating budget [2], which is actually very good for a public transportation agency. For comparison, the passenger fares received in the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Agency (VTA) only account for about 10% of their operating budget [3]. So the airport surcharges are one part of creating a more responsible budget and operation plan while keeping the system accessible for commuters. I\'m always a little bit surprised when I can say a public agency is acting responsibly... good job, BART.And in response to Toni Shuma\'s questions, I did a bit of fun research with BART\'s public records: * The original FY10 budget included this fare increase and many other budget cuts to account for "the worst recession ever experienced by BART". However, BART employees threatened to strike due to the labor cuts that were planned. After labor negotiations were settled, the revised budget was published in early 2010. [13]So- in answer to the question of did this increased fare result in either increased revenue or decreased ridership: There was a large dip in riders between 2009 and 2011, but BART attributes this to the recession, not a direct correlation to fare increases (but could be related). In 2010 and 2011, BART was conservative on their estimates of operating revenue (probably due to the obvious dips in ridership), but their actual revenue has increased each year regardless of actual ridership.Note- the Average Revenue per Rider was just a fun metric I wanted to see, but\xc2\xa0 can be misleading, as there are even more variables that would go into average fare collected per BART rider (length of trip, more paid parking available, etc)[1] SFO Commission Calls BART Surcharge for SFO Workers \xe2\x80\x9cUnconscionable\xe2\x80\x9d[2] http://www.bart.gov/docs/financi...

Which they are, really, as they\'re brand new planes.Seat Comfort: Double-check at www.seatguru.com, but most of their seats have 1" to 2" more leg room than most competing airlines, and their Main Cabin Select seats are 34" to 36" if I remember correctly. Combined with remarkably thin seat backs, and no floor-installed entertainment boxes, leg room is really quite good. The biggest issue I have with their seats are the actual seat cushions -- I think I\'ve sat on more comfortable rocks. They really are quite firm, though not to the point of being actually uncomfortable. That said, Southwest\'s plush seats take the cake: by far and away the most comfortable on domestic carriers.Frequent Flyer Program: Because I\'ve been flying with VX so long and so frequently, I\'ve been complaining to them about this forever: their frequent flier program, aside from the rapidity* with which you can accumulate points, is essentially a non-program: not only do you not get any perks for being a frequent flyer, they don\'t even let you upgrade your seat to Main Cabin Select (exit row and front bulkhead seats) or First Class. Having spoken with VX abou this on at least two occasions, they assured me they\'re definitely working on trying to remedy at least one of these matters. Time will tell. That said, when used in conjunction with their Virgin VISA Card (issued by Barclays), you can rack up points very fast indeed.Airline Partner Programs: Besides several of the other airlines in the Virgin franchise, no partnerships exist as yet. So racking up on VX points is really only going to help you on domestic flights for now.Flight Crew: As a male, my response here cannot be anything other than purely subjective and I will therefore make the same disclaimer I tell my girlfriend who agrees fully with me: if I\'m forced to endure a small aluminum and titanium tube with wings with the comfort of a sardine can (I\'m 6\'5" / 2m tall) for up to six hours, I want my flight crew to be professional, friendly, in good spirits, and yes, female and attractive. VX destroys the competition in this regard as it has by far and away the most pleasant and professional flight crew of any domestic carrier.Amenities: Wi-Fi on all planes, sometimes actually fast enough to watch Netflix or engage in webcam calls. AC power at all seats, though you\'ll need to be capable of actually twisting yourself into a pretzel if you want to find and reach the power socket while strapped into your seat. And finally, Virgin\'s famous Linux-based RED entertainment system, a seat-back computer from which you can watch DirecTV, movies, listen to music, order food and drink, etc. The interface is a bit slow and sluggish, but definitely delivers the goods.Flexbility: Terrible. Plain and simple. You only have 24 hours to change or cancel your flight. After that you get a change penalty on top of any difference in fare.Final thoughts compared to other carriers: AA has started installing their new "shell seats" in Economy Class. Google this if you don\'t know what it is. Let me put it this way. Cathay Pacific, heretofore the highest ranked Pacific route airline, recently started installing these seats in all their 747 aircraft. Less than a year later (I have heard, but not yet confirmed) they are already uninstalling them due to passengers\' complaints. For this reason alone, and having been forced to endure these seats on an SFO-BOS-SFO flight, I will never again fly AA until they remove them. UA has the most unfriendly, unprofessional, and just plain grumpy -- not to mention rude -- flight crew I\'ve ever experienced. Delta I\'ve weirdly never had the chance to fly. Continental I\'ve flown infrequently and found them to be quite average despite their stellar reviews (for a legacy airline, anyway). And Southwest definitely has pleasant flight crews although I don\'t care for the "public bus" feeling of their aircraft or cattle call style boarding system. All these factors taken into account, despite a few minor issues, VX really is a new generation of airline and it is still my airline of choice for any domestic flight.---------------------* By "rapidity," I mean that points appear on your account virtually as soon as you earn them.

This more or less rules out mechanical failure as the cause of the crash.With 4 seconds to impact, the pilots got a stall warning from the aircraft due to the airspeed.With 1.5 seconds, the pilots called for a "go around" and tried to increase their speed and altitude to make another approach. It was too late.The pilot at the controls had never flown a 777 into SFO before, although he had landed large jets there. He had 43 hours total at 777 controls. A crew of experienced pilots was on board but none of them noticed what observers on the ground saw (and apparently some passengers on board): That the plane\'s approach was too low.It\'s always hazardous to draw definitive conclusions in a case like this, but it is nearly apparent that an additional 10-20 feet of altitude allows the plane to avoid crashing into the seawall. An additional 10-30 knots of air speed probably causes the descent to slow just enough that the altitude is higher at the time of approach. A recognition of this impending disaster even 10-20 seconds earlier would almost certainly have been enough to avoid this problem.SFO\'s Instrument Landing System was offline at the time of the crash, but conditions were nearly perfect: clear skies, minimal wind. Normally, this kind of landing is completely routine for commercial pilots without the ILS in these kind of conditions. Saturday July 5 was not a routine day.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 255, 'answer_user': 'Mark Rogowsky'}, {'answer': 'As a huge aviation enthusiast, a private pilot myself, and a huge fan of the Triple 7, I at first had the same reaction - how in the world...?Then I\'m hearing about the tail section breaking off while landing and my confusion grows. With you, how in the world?? The 777 is my very favorite jet to fly. I haven\'t heard anything re: fatalities but as of this morning no 777 has crashed with loss of life.All I can add right this second is a pilot friend who was at SFO and turned around when he heard commotion to see what was up didn\'t see the actual "ground joined" moment, BUT seconds afterwards, judging by what he could see, he is thinking it landed short, and speculated the pilot\'s initial response - a quick pullback on the yolk to try and "bunny-hop" onto the runway resulted in an extreme short-of-runway tail strike. At the speed that 777 was landing at, depending on how hard he potentially yanked back on the control\'s...plenty of forces at work there to break off the tail section and then, with drastically-depleted or realistically probably no horizontal or vertical control, it quickly rolled and hit the runway hard (I keep hearing reports it rolled or was in the process of rolling before it hit the runway). Again...how in the world. My friend flies heavies with United, but again it\'s pure speculation right now. And as he said himself, he truly just saw the impact, blurred window, people everywhere in front of him (he is 6\'7" however), smoke and dust covering the crash scene quickly (he DID say "brown dust" interestingly, just remembered that). I can\'t imagine a trained 777 pilot actually trying to bunny-hop a short-of-runway landing to get on the runway. Something I would not have tried at 16 in our 172!

At the time it was landing, the ILS (Instrument Landing System) which includes the glideslope for vertical guidance and the localizer for horizontal guidance was out of service. The pilot was cleared for a visual approach, however, so it was not required.There have been conflicting reports if the PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) which is a series of red and white lights that indicate if you are too high or too low visually was operating or not. Regardless, the pilots would, however, have been able to use a GPS approach to runway if they wanted electronic glide path guidance. The chart for that approach is below:From what we know so far, it's clear that the aircraft was way below a safe glide path causing the landing gear and tail to strike at the seawall at the end of the runway.This statement was from a United Airlines pilot who was holding short of runway 28L at the time of the accident:On July 6, 2013 at approximately 1827Z I was the 747-400 relief F/O on flt 885, ID326/06 SFO-KIX. I was a witness to the Asiana Flt 214 accident. We had taxied to hold short of runway 28L at SFO on taxiway F, and were waiting to rectify a HAZMAT cargo issue as well as our final weights before we could run our before takeoff checklist and depart. As we waited on taxiway F heading East, just prior to the perpendicular holding area, all three pilots took notice of the Asiana 777 on short final. I noticed the aircraft looked low on glidepath and had a very high deck angle compared to what seemed \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d. I then noticed at the apparent descent rate and closure to the runway environment the aircraft looked as though it was going to impact the approach lights mounted on piers in the SF Bay. The aircraft made a fairly drastic looking pull up in the last few feet and it appeared and sounded as if they had applied maximum thrust. However the descent path they were on continued and the thrust applied didn't appear to come soon enough to prevent impact. The tail cone and empennage of the 777 impacted the bulkhead seawall and departed the airplane and the main landing gear sheared off instantly. This created a long debris field along the arrival end of 28L, mostly along the right side of 28L. We saw the fuselage, largely intact, slide down the runway and out of view of our cockpit. We heard much confusion and quick instructions from SFO Tower and a few moments later heard an aircraft go around over the runway 28 complex. We realized within a few moments that we were apparently unharmed so I got on the PA and instructed everyone to remain seated and that we were safe. An experienced Delta Pilot I know provided the following theory (and political commentary):This crew tried to correct heavy sink with further aggrevated back pressure thinking that pulling back would help. Its like our economy. You would think that more taxes, more government programs and increased debt ceiling would effect a correction in the proper direction. The truth is that what we are doing is further aggrevating the problem, just like these guys showed us.Here is an example of a normal landing (not mine) on runway 28L at SFO:As you can see, the aircraft touches down beyond the 1000ft markers (solid white bars) and passes over the end of the runway at a safe altitude of about 50ft.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 48, 'answer_user': 'Andrew Stagg'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 11, 0, 3), 'tag': ['Asiana Flight 214 Crash (July 2013)', 'Boeing 777', 'San Francisco International Airport (SFO)', 'Aviation Accidents and Incidents'], 'question_user': 'Jon Rodriguez'}

It seems to break down to several things:The relative rarity of the event - Even if African and Asian nations where some of the worst maintained commercial airlines routinely fly and are based, crashes are exceptionally rare. In North American and Europe, they are almost non-existent. When they do occur, they often feed into:Confirmation biases - People who dislike or fear flying almost always have their fears and hatred confirmed when a plane crashes. Despite the lottery win levels of chance that it will occur, when it does these people have a willing media ready and able to report the rarity as if it is something which happens far more often.Plane crashes used to end in complete fatalities - Until the late 1980s, the majority of serious crashes , while again rare, end with the deaths of all of the passengers. Since these numbers were usually in hundreds, this made plane crashes exceptional events which the media relished in covering.9/11 - Even now, 12 years after the event, the media consistently reports that a plane crash did not involve terrorism. Since the overwhelming majority of aircraft incidents are either pilot error or mechanical incidents, there really shouldn\'t be a need to report this. But then again, the media is built upon making the exception seem to be the rule.Slow news days - Nothing makes a slow news period seem to be "exciting" like a plane crash. The media can fill several or more news cycles with the relatively rare event and they can cover from all angles from local to international. An aircraft mishap, like the unexpected death of a major celebrity, is tailor-made for full exploitation by the media.When I\'m writing this, there are several continuing conflicts in Africa and Asia, a major train mishap in Quebec,Canada and the on-going weather-related issues due to climate change.

We cede an unusual amount of control when we do so - you can't tell the pilot to stop and let you out, people generally have no idea how a plane works, landmarks can be hard to identify so you can't really see where you are going.

{'qid': 406, 'ans_num': 4, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85What is United Airlines' market share for flights out of SFO?", 'answers': [{'answer': 'Here\'s how United stacks up for the time period Nov 2009-Oct. 2010 based on the metrics published by SFO in CSV format (http://flysfo.com/web/page/about...). All of SFO\'s publications are amenable to pivot tables, so I\'ve broken these metrics out a tiny bit further below.By cargoUnited carried the plurality of cargo (23% of all tonnage) into and out of SFO from Nov. 2009-Oct. 2010:If you wanted to treat the question a little more precisely, you could note that it asks about United\'s market share for flights out of SFO. Well, OK, here are the numbers for flights where cargo is "enplaned" only (only for outbound cargo flights):United holds steady at 23% -- which means that the numbers of tons of cargo entering SFO and leaving SFO on UA planes over this time period were about equal. Pretty cool!By landingsUnited operated 49% of aircraft landings into SFO from Nov. 2009 - Oct. 2010. That\'s not the whole story because flights published as "United" may be operated by Skywest contracted as United Express.Of those 49%, half were operated by United, and half were operated by Skywest on United\'s behalf (United was the publishing, but not the operating, carrier). Here are the numbers showing both publishing carrier and operating carrier.By landed weightThis metric is a little silly.40% of all landed weight at SFO came from United-published flights; of that, most was United-operated but a little bit was Skywest.By passengers (into and out of SFO)United carried 40% of all passengers into and out of SFO from Nov. 2009-Oct. 2010: The above table is a crude summary that doesn\'t quite conform to the actual standard SFO uses for passenger counts. SFO sums up# deplanements + #enplanements + 2 * #thru-transitwhile in this table I have just summed up# deplanements + #enplanements + #thru-transitHere\'s the difference:deplanements - passenger got off any plane in SFOenplanements - passenger got on any plane in SFOthru/transit - passenger got off a plane in SFO, and then got on another plane on the same airline and with the same flight number (these flights are called "direct flights").An example: UA837 refers to both a United flight from DFW to SFO and also a flight from SFO to NRT. The flights are operated by different physical airplanes, but if you take this "direct" flight for both segments, you count as 0 enplanements, 0 deplanements, and 1 thru/transit passenger. You get weighted twice as heavily in "total passenger throughput" numbers.Incidentally, we can measure UA\'s market share on "flights out of SFO", which the question asks, by looking at only # thru/transit + # enplanements.

{'qid': 409, 'ans_num': 2, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85Why does SFO only have 4 runways? Why didn't they build more during one of the boom eras?", 'answers': [{'answer': "SFO's runways have long been a contentious issue. The main problem with SFO's configuration (2 sets of parallel runways) is that the parallel runways are too close to each other (750ft) to allow for simultaneous landings during inclement weather. The FAA mandates that planes doing a parallel landing at SFO must be able to see each other during the landing, which is impossible during cloudy weather. This effectively cuts airport capacity in half, creating major delays. If the parallel runways were farther apart, like they are in LAX, Hong Kong, and London Heathrow, this would be much less of an issue. During the boom of Y2K, SFO's traffic rates were extremely high. In fact in 2000, SFO was the 9th busiest airport in the world and has since fallen to 20th. It was during this period that plans for new runways were resurrected. Since there is no land available in the airport, the plan was to create new parallel runways in the bay by reclaiming more land. The picture below shows what these new runways would look like:http://www.sfba.org/sfo/image1.jpgThis is the current configuration:http://www.sfba.org/sfo/image0.jpgThis of course was met with massive opposition from environmental groups. Reclaiming land in the Bay destroys large animal habitats and disrupts local ecosystems created by tidal movements. Residents were worried that the additional airport capacity offered by new runways would mean more flights that would create more noise and pollution over their homes. Furthermore, a new runway in the bay positioned northeast from the existing 28R runway would send planes over an area that is not under any existing flightpaths, increasing the number of homes that would be affected by airplanes using the airport. Traffic numbers are starting to increase again at SFO and the massive delays will return. Soon there will be renewed calls for runway construction, but the Save the Bay coalitions have so much clout that politicians will likely not give much support to expansion and any attempts will be mired in years of litigation. Before the 1960s, people were adding land in the Bay with little regard for the environment, and the Bay soon turned into a cesspool of chemicals and raw sewage. In fact, since 1770, the Bay has decreased in size by 33% due to land reclaiming (San Francisco's current financial district used to be covered by water). During the 1960s, California passed a series of legislation that made it very difficult to build anything new in the Bay and created the Bay Conservation and Development Commission to ensure the environmental stability of the Bay. So in exchange for a much cleaner Bay than before, getting approval for a new bayside development is a bureaucratic and legal nightmare.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 132, 'answer_user': 'Raj Misra'}, {'answer': "SFO has four runways, two sets of two parallel runways.

I\'ll give my perspective as a man dating women in SF and try to add a little of what I\'ve been told by straight/bi women who are on tinder. I don\'t know enough about the experience for women dating women or men dating men to have any perspective on it.I\'ve used both Tinder and OKCupid, which is a more traditional internet dating site.The general impression is that Tinder is a little less serious, which makes sense--getting on OKCupid involves uploading pictures, writing a profile, and answering questions, whereas on Tinder you just link it to your facebook, select pictures, and go. Relatedly, there\'s somewhat more of an association between Tinder and hookups than with other dating sites, but many people still use it for more traditional dating. I haven\'t had any Tinder hookups (in fairness, I haven\'t been looking for them), but I\'ve had quite a few Tinder dates, and even one short (~3 month) relationship. The other biggest difference between Tinder and other more traditional dating sites is that on OKCupid, women may be messaged by any man with interest--which leads to the most attractive women coming under constant barrage (mostly with low-quality messages like "sup"). Tinder requires that two people "swipe right" on each other before they can communicate; solving this problem.A result of this is that the average attractiveness of girls on Tinder tends to be much higher than on OKCupid, where a lot of the more attractive girls are scared off by the high quantity of messages, many of which are sexually explicit.Tinder also links directly to a facebook profile, making it harder (but not impossible) to create fake profiles. I haven\'t personally used Tinder outside of SF, but most of the women I\'ve talked to about it have stated that it seems like the guys are more active here / better looking than in other cities (we speculate that this is because there are more single guys out here per single girl than in other cities).Embed QuoteVia  Riley Patterson.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Tom Gwinn'}, {'answer': 'It is fun and noncommittal.

I have been running the SF Marathon (2nd half most of the time for about 10, 12 years).\xc2\xa0 A few things to consider:1) Are you local or are you flying in for the race? If you are flying in then staying in SF is perhaps an option and therefore you can get to the 1st half with no problem (starts @ 5:30am!!). If you are a local and say, live in San Jose it's kind of hard to get to a 5:30 am race. It becomes more of a production (get a hotel room in the city, stay with friends, etc). If you like to sleep a few more hours the night before the race, do the 2nd half. 2) Are you looking for a PR? The course is hard and hilly, not the best for a PR. However, if you had to choose one, the 2nd half course is a little better for that. 3) Do you care where the race ends? The first half ends in Golden Gate Park and not at the marathon finish line. In my humble opinion it's kind of anti-climatic to end at Golden Gate Park: not many people cheering, you did not finish with the marathoners, not much of an expo at the park and you might still have to take the shuttle back to the starting/finish line. If you do the 2nd half you finish with the marathoners, tons of people cheering and you are right at the expo. 4) Do you care about the sights? Do you want to run on the Golden Gate? Do you want to run through the Haight? If you care, pick depending on what neighborhood you want to experience. I would recommend running on the Golden Gate at least once. 5) Do you prefer to run in the cool weather (i.e 5:30 am 1st half) or in 'warm' weather (i.e. 8:30 am 2nd half)? I would personally recommend the 2nd half: you don't have to wake up very early for it, you end at the main finish line, the weather (most of the time) is a bit better and the course is less hilly. However, regardless of what half you choose, at the end of the day it's still running and it's still San Francisco; not a bad way to spend a Sunday morning, don't you think?Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Icaro Vazquez'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 25, 14, 30), 'tag': ['The San Francisco Marathon', 'Half Marathons', 'Running', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'James Chong'}

Here\'s Hugh Macleod of http://gapingvoid.com (who does the posters for the annual Techcrunch parties)\xc2\xa0 standing in front of it. Unfortunately you can\'t get past the gate unless you are lucky or know an executive inside HP. We got a tour once, here\'s Brian Solis\' pictures of that day: http://bub.blicio.us/touring-the...Why there? It\'s the birthplace of Silicon Valley and really everything flows out from here. Total time needed? 15 minutes to read the plaque and snap some photos.Next, I\'d head to University Cafe. Say hi to Flipboard as you pass by, along with a few other startups. See the Whole Foods? That\'s where Steve Jobs shops for his groceries. Why is University Cafe important? Well, this is where Ron Conway met Mark Zuckerberg. He invested. The rest is history. I love to sit outside and think about all the porn going underneath the street (I remember when they ripped up the street and laid in tons of fiber heading into Stanford University).If we really want to get double caffeinated, visit Coupa Cafe, nearby. I always run into CEOs and VCs there. After your coffee, head up the street so you can take a photo in front "Lucky 165 University Ave": http://milo.com/blog/lucky-165-u... early office of Google, PayPal, Logitech, and many other startups.Next I\'d take you to Stanford University. We\'ll visit two things here. First, the Cantor Arts Center. http://museum.stanford.edu/ Why? It\'s a great free museum, but holds the key for what made Leland Stanford all the money he needed to buy "the Farm:" the golden spike. See, Silicon Valley started as a railroad town, which explains our next stop after we leave Stanford.From there we\'d visit the chapel in the Quad, where you can see some great stained glass, like this:And learn some of the spiritual reasons why the Stanfords\' donated their money and time to making a great University here (which really led to the development of HP, etc.From there I\'d take you to the Gates Building, which is the home of the Computer Science department. Inside I\'d introduce you to the folks doing bleeding edge photographic research, like what Marc Levoy was doing here:Or the robotic work, or other work. There\'s tons of interesting stuff going on in this building every semester.From there I\'d take you on a tour of tons of different things. If you got the really great tour, we\'d stop over at the Automotive Research labs and try to get a ride in their self-driving car, among other cool projects.Next, I\'d take you to the heart of Silicon Valley. First, let\'s visit the Santa Clara railyard, which has a neat history museum in it (I love one of the photos, which is of the railyard with nothing surrounding it). Next, we\'ll visit the Interlocking Machine, stored in this shed:Inside is one of Silicon Valley\'s first computers. Tons of commuters ride by every day without knowing what a great machine is stored inside. It\'s a mechanical computer. You pull out a slide and tell the system "if this slide is pulled out, then close this rail, else a crash will happen." Programmers will see the "if, then, else" logic carved into metal. Later computers will take over these jobs (the same job now is run from a computer in Omaha, NE).More details about this: http://www.sbhrs.org/ for the museum\'s site and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San... for the wikipedia entry.Under the shed, by the way, runs some strands of fiber to Santa Clara University.That will take an hour to get through, more if you actually got someone to give you a tour of the Interlocking Machine.Next, let\'s head to the Tech Museum. http://www.thetech.org/ This is a neat hands-on museum that is fun to visit and learn about the technology that runs under everything.

Get a milkshake at the Creamery, a slice at Pizza my Heart, and maybe a beer at the Rose & Crown. Once you've digested downtown Palo Alto (this won't take more than an hour or so), head to campus, where there are any number of places you should see. Drive up Palm Drive and park in the oval.First and foremost for a technophile, the Gates Computer Science building is not only the place where many entrepreneurs of the past fifteen years cut their teeth on their way to building Yahoo! and Google and all the others, but also has several wonderful computer history exhibits and the offices of some of the brightest minds in Computer Science today. Across the street is the Packard building, and if you walk around the halls of Gates and Packard looking for open doors, you're more than likely to stumble across a professor or grad student that's more than willing to nerd out with you for a little bit if you only think to ask. Just ask them what they're working on.Another thing that's not to be missed in my opinion is the Silicon Valley family tree poster. I believe it's in the Jackson Business Library down Serra Mall from the engineering quad, although this might be in Gates as well. It's a gigantic poster that tracks Silicon Valley companies and their descendants from Fredrick Terman and Hewlett-Packard, National Semiconductor (be amazed at how many companies they spawned), and Fairchild down through PARC, Apple, MIPS and the rest. I think it goes up until the mid-90's or so. If you're at all interested in the history of the valley you can stare at it for hours.The whole campus is beautiful, you should take the campus tour where the Visitor Information Services guides will tell you the stock stories both fact and legend about the luminaries of the tech world and their times at Stanford. Afterwards, see the Rodin sculpture garden, maybe try to sit and reflect near a fountain somewhere. If you're coming from the northeast, you may never go home.Most importantly, I'd say is try to talk to people.

Looking on Craigslist, you could get a decent room in the city for about $1200 a month. Figure in another $1200 for food and expenses and that brings you up to $4000 a month.

It depends what you want to maximize. If we assume your list is in order -- that weather is really important for your team and proximity to techies isn\'t -- I suggest the East Bay. Someplace in Oakland or Berkeley.Weather: Much better than the city.Co-working: I believe this exists. If not, rents are cheap, by Bay Area standards.There\'s lots of nightlife and interesting things happening, all the time.The mountains and rest of California are one fewer bridge away.Other techies can be found. It\'s not as dense as SoMA, but it\'s not bad either. If not, SoMA is a BART ride away (so get a place very very close to BART! This is very important!)Your second option is the Mission district of SF. The weather is okay, better than many places in SF. Fog and cloud actually bend around the Mission valley -- locals call it "the donut". Co-working is available, and there are techies and startups around, also the NoiseBridge hacker space, also ten million hipsters. The nightlife is the most vibrant of the entire city. There is no outdoorsy activity whatsoever, except for hipster sports in Dolores Park like lawn bowling or slacklining. Did I mention hipsters? You can pretty much locate yourself anywhere in the Mission; no need to stick close to BART, although in practice commercial spaces tend to be between Valencia and Van Ness.\xc2\xa0Caveat: the East Bay and the Mission have higher crime rates than other areas. You will also encounter non-white people who do not have technology jobs. Remain calm.Third option is SOMA. Weather sucks like the rest of SF. Rents are sky-high, but co-working is possible. Nightlife is kind of meh, but you can BART to more interesting places. No outdoors activity at all. Quantity of techies and startuppers: higher than any place on Planet Earth.Fourth option: peninsula (everything between SF and San Jose). Mountain View is probably the best option for a startup, especially one from NYC. Lots of small and large tech companies around. Google\'s campus is here, Yahoo is next door, Facebook is a couple of Caltrain stops over, but you also have little outfits like Meebo and a hundred others. Lots of restaurants and the place has something that a NYC\'er might dimly recognize as an actually functioning downtown. Outdoors: endless suburbia/tech parks, but you, um, have a view of the nearby mountains. If you locate in downtown Mountain View, you can avoid the usual Silicon Valley trap of having to get into your car whenever you want to take lunch with anyone. It has to be mentioned: if you are from NYC you are going to be really depressed by the peninsula\'s restaurants and nightlife.Side benefit: VC firms and tech giants like Google are located in the peninsula, and travel time to your offices has been known to influence their decisions. If you are very concerned about proximity to investors and acquirers, locating in the East Bay is the worst option.P.S. In general, the Bay Area\'s where-should-I-locate problem is insoluble to a degree that a New Yorker probably cannot appreciate. Every place offers severe tradeoffs.P.P.S. "Commuting into the city for events doesn\'t really bother us." That\'s what you think now, but you will probably find that if you locate in someplace like Mountain View, you simply won\'t have the werewithal to go to SF for events, especially after a day of working on your startup. I worked for an event listings website in the valley and we found we simply couldn\'t make time to actually go to many events.

There are a TON of startups in the area that operate out of their houses. And you are super close to FB, Yahoo, Google, etc...The rent ain't cheap, but being from NYC you're probably used to that, and between the four of you, it's doable. For outdoor activities, there's a lot of biking and hiking pretty close by.

It's a biking city, and there are some amazing hikes around there as well as water sports like kayaking and paddle boarding.

Let me explain:\xc2\xa0In the past several decades San Francisco has let NIMBYism take control of its zoning policy. It has become extremely difficult to build substantial new housing in the city, and over time this has created a housing market that has way fewer units than a city its size and economic prominence should have. This recent zoning map is particularly telling: yellow means that new construction must be four-stories or less \xe2\x80\x94 so even if developers manage to get a project through SF\'s bureaucratic planning labyrinth, it probably won\'t make much of a dent in the housing deficit.This severe shortage of housing means every time there is an economic boom, rents skyrocket, and countless middle- and lower-class people are displaced as the upper class pours in. So yes, these zoning laws do hurt SF\'s residents....with a few exceptions.There are a few SF residents who benefit from these anti-urban zoning laws: The rich and politically-connected NIMBYs who shaped these anti-construction policies in the first place. The Telegraph Hill Dwellers are perhaps the most famous group within this small yet powerful enclave. Any time a new project crops up, they pour huge amounts of money into campaigns to fight it. they operate under the pretense of "protecting the unique and historic character of San Francisco", whereas in reality, they\'re fighting to protect their precious views and artificially over-inflated property values. Time and time again, SF\'s lower classes are swayed by this romantic rhetoric, and instinctively fight all new housing projects in their neighborhood \xe2\x80\x94 and they will still be surprised when the next boom comes and their rents go through the roof. The NIMBY\'s have been able to make a scapegoat of the incoming tech industry, whereas the real blame lies in the hands of those who so vigorously fought new development.

[2] Conflicting studies show that the population could go anywhere from 8.4 million to 9.5 million by 2040 [3]. Given the high cost of building highway infrastructure, as well as limited land space, transportation and city planners are focusing on ways to create more transit-friendly environments that is convenient for living, working, and playing.Given the high cost of living in the City & County of San Francisco, this sort of planning is actually beneficial for San Francisco; given SF\'s limited space, SF\'s neighbors in the East Bay can alleviate some of its housing pain.

In SF in particular, they get hit up by app-makers and startups and vendors more than you\'d think, and they aren\'t likely to want to drop everything and give their attention to something they half-fear already. And many of them already don\'t like techies or apps.I think the best way would be:Choose individuals to contact by looking at restaurants you think your app is good for and then find their owners / managers on social media. You want those folks with at least an FB page or a Twitter account. This both (a) assures they\'re a little savvy and (b) gives you an easy way to contact them.Contact individuals directly to ask for a 15- to 30-minute block of time, or whatever they can spare; meet them where they are, be quick, do not pitch, and listen, listen, listen; ask in your message if there\'s any way you can repay them for their time or help them with anythingLook for forums where restauranteurs hang out and interact, and follow restauranteur blogs; find people active in that scene and see if they\'re willing to check out your app and give feedback, tooCall folks if you can\'t get them on social media or by email.You can of course try to just demo on-the-spot with folks, but we had better success with scheduling meetings and demos ultimately than we did just walking up.

I drive between Mountain View and west San Jose, about 18 miles each way, and the trip is 10-20 minutes shorter with the carpool lane (30-40 minutes total, vs. 40-60 outside the carpool lane).Unfortunately for me, the benefit used to be even greater, but as more and more techies have bought electric cars, the carpool lanes in the south bay have gotten more and more crowded.

Before I got my Tesla I could plan on it taking an hour or more from home to work. With the stickers I'm under half an hour.As I said, your mileage may vary (no pun intended) based on specifically where you are and the proportion of HOV lanes on your route, but I can also tell you that part of this is more than sheer time. The half an hour I save each way pales in comparison to the lack of frustration and stress involved in my commute. You might be able to put a value on time, but it's much harder to put a value on lack of stress. Heck, you might even come to *enjoy* your daily commute and that's almost priceless.The other saving to consider is running costs of your car. Even if you don't think the time and stress savings warrant buying a Tesla, the running costs might. Assuming a 50-mile one way trip (100 mile per day commute), and a car that runs at 20mpg average you'll be paying for 5 gallons of gas - that's $20 at $4/gal - per day.

A good mover will send a representative to your home to see what needs to be moved before they give you a final price estimate. This is done for your protection and it's free. Any mover that tells you otherwise is being shady.I usually suggest that people start with finding agents for the national van lines (United, Mayflower, Atlas, etc.) because you can expect a certain level of consistency in claims procedures, equipments, service, etc. when you work with a national brand. That said, there are a lot of great independent movers out there too - you'll just need to vet them very carefully before hiring them. Check out www.protectyourmove.gov - you can enter in your movers MC and/or DOT numbers to see their record and make sure they are legit. Be wary of online moving brokers and customer review sites (except for www.movingscam.com) - they are often playgrounds for less than honest movers.

That will be checked through your application process. (And you will be surprised how little you get for $2350; it is really depressing.)On a $85k salary, there is a HUGE leeway as to how much you can make available to yourself after the cost of living which includes rent. With roommates, you can bring that down to the sub-$1000 range pretty easily. If you want to have your own place, you can still find something with what you are making.Personally, if you are young, single and make $85k, you should be able to adjust your lifestyle to live very comfortably, even in San Francisco. Depending on how you control rent for yourself, you can choose to save a lot, live lavishly with what remains, or splurge on a "nice" place (which would cost a fraction monthly elsewhere) and live frugally on other parts. I think you will have that choice, at least.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Taro Sato'}, {'answer': "It all depend on your lifestyle, what neighborhood you want to live in and how you eat / spend your time. Many people live in SF on a lot less than $85k. If you live in SOMA or Pac Heights - sure you can spend $3000+ for a 1 bedroom. But you don't have to if that's too expensive. There are plenty of less expensive areas and sometimes landlords don't charge the outrageous high prices. I currently pay $2,700 for a whole house, newly renovated with a garage and a backyard. The difference? My landlords have owned it for 70 years and they're not greedy. They could get $3,500+. Plus I live pretty far from downtown so there's less competition. Likewise you can get a haircut downtown for $100 or you can go to one of the neighborhoods and get a really nice haircut for $20. You can go to the trendy bars and restaurants and pay about double what you'll pay at a nice local place. Your choice - there are options for every budget. You can pay $5 for a cup of hand drip coffee but there's plenty of local places selling normal coffee for $1.65. I saw a made in China jacket going for $400 in Hayes Valley. Nothing special about it. Macy's is a whole lot cheaper. So, all depends on where you go and how you want to live. Want to have a BMW? You better pay for a monthly parking spot. Want to hang out in a trendy place? Be ready to pay double or triple. All in all, I think $85k is a healthy salary to live anywhere. Depends on how you spend your money.

The success of your conversation will depend on how you both react to each other. Use your best judgement--if someone is reading a book or listening to music, or already talking to someone else, they might not want to be bothered.If there's a delay, it's common for people to express their frustration aloud, which sparks a conversation between riders. I've seen groups of fans begin conversations while riding BART to the Oakland Coliseum to watch the Warriors play. If it ever gets awkward, you can always move to a different car.In the context of your question, though, it may be more difficult to start a conversation during commute hours. In the morning, most people are either asleep or trying not to fall when the train moves. In the evening, people are tired.

Petersen'}, {'answer': "It's not that different most other cities in terms of traffic and the ever present possibility of getting run over. If you've bikes in other large cities SF is not really any worse. I got around exclusively by bike in Washington DC for over ten years so I wasn't particularly intimidated by SF traffic. However if you are just learning how to ride a bike, as in the basic mechanics of staying upright, you probably want to spend lots of time in the park just getting used to riding and the 'personality' of your bike. You probably see those courier guys buzzing around with no hands through busy downtown intersections and think you can quickly get to that level of skill--but it takes awhile. First get comfortable enough with riding that you know longer think about it: get the point where riding becomes second nature. When riding in traffic you have to be attentive to dozens of details every second and prepared to act instantaneously--you have to anticipate what drivers might do (often based on watching them for only a few seconds to get a quick feel for their behavior), you check rear view mirrors on parked cars to take note of which are occupied and might 'door' you, you must constantly keep an eye on the road for debris and potholes, all the while timing traffic lights and watching out for pedestrians. Don't get yourself into that situation without becoming a competent rider first.Once you've gotten experienced on your bike and increasingly comfortable in traffic you can slowly do more urban riding. Maybe just stick to areas like the Sunset, the Presidio, Marina, and SOMA at first then work your way up to biking downtown and tackling hills around Telegraph, Potrero, etc, etc. SOMA is nice and flat with wide streets and very little traffic, and you could probably practice safely (just be careful with 101 traffic as it enters/exits the freeway)...but the speeds just aren't very forgiving around there. I would originally just stick to an area with a more suburban feel, where cars go max 20-25mph, and where there is a stop sign on every corner. You will get in accidents, and you will get scraped up--some accidents will be your fault and some won't be. Either way, the difference between a scrape with a bruised ego and quadriplegia/death is largely one of speed and power. Also please invest $25-100 to protect your most important possession: your brain. Wear a helmet. My head has bounced off both windshields and pavement in various accidents and I shudder to think how bad it could've been without one. SF traffic alone isn't really all that bad and moves slowly enough downtown that the real risks are doors and being cut-off by drivers who fail to do a head check (happens all the time, trust me). The taxis in SF are rather dangerous, but the real challenge is the hills. There have been a few where the grade felt quite dangerous riding my brake all the way down. In SF there's always an intersection at the bottom of the hill so you can't simply roll on through. I noticed on my jaunts up to SF (I went to school on the peninsula and lived on a suburban campus) that I would find myself peddling up some brutal hill completely alone, or going down some extremely steep hill, again completely alone. Then I would spend a little time along a flat road and see a fair number of cyclists. And then finally it occurred to me: the cyclists around there have flat routes they all know and use. Only an out-of-towner would push it up some of those hills simply to go from A to B.Friends have mentioned cyclist-friendly maps that illustrate the flatter, bike friendlier routes around the city.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Matthew Sutton'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 4, 17, 39), 'tag': ['San Francisco', 'Bicycles', 'Transportation', 'Cycling', 'Cities and Metro Areas', 'Learning New Things'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}
