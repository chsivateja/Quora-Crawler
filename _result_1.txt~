Even for ones that I haven\'t visited, the Chinese Exclusion Act from 1880-1943 created a large generational gap between present day Chinese-Americans. Since there was almost a 60-year gap between the two major waves of Chinese immigration, some Chinatowns (New York) which are comprised of early Chinese Immigrants from Northern China tend to speak Mandarin as their primary dialect and through the generations, will likely have picked up English as a fluent second language. The Post-Exclusion Act Chinese immigrants tend to have immigrated from Southern China - fleeing political turmoil of the cultural revolution - and are mostly Cantonese speakers. Since post-exclusion act Chinese immigrants are only in their 1st and 2nd generations in the US, this wave of Chinese-Americans are less likely to speak English fluently.The varying immigration times and causes have led to a few subtleties between Chinatowns across the US. I make the note about the generational gap because depending on which Chinatown you go to, you\'ll either be fine ordering with English..or you may end up with an interesting plate :-)---Anyway, of the three Chinatown\'s I\'ve been to:Oakland: The most functional of Chinatowns. Oakland\'s Chinatown attracts little tourism and is a six block collective of high rise apartment buildings comprised of ethnic Chinese residents, grocery markets, small shops, regional banks, restaurants and schools.Since Oakland\'s Chinatown has almost no tourist appeal whatsoever, it has the cheapest and best tasting Chinese food. By best Chinese food, I\'m speaking from the perspective of someone who never orders "Orange Chicken" and despises Panda Express. You\'ll be hard pressed to find pagodas and dragons on every street corner in Oakland\'s chinatownCantonese is the predominant dialect spoken in Oakland Chinatown. I\'d venture to 99:1 on Cantonese:Mandarin.San Francisco: One of the largest, most visited, and touristy Chinatowns. Due to SF\'s massive worldwide appeal, Chinatown is a popular stop for tourists. There\'s a number of buildings and structures that are built with the stereotype Chinatown feel (pagoda like, green/yellow/red paints, lots of dragons and pillars). The food is also good in San Francisco, but of lesser quality and more expensive than Oakland.Most of San Francisco\'s long time Chinese population actually live around Inner Richmond and the Sunset which has a more Oakland Chinatown feel if you ever walk around clement and 8th.Cantonese is the predominant dialect as well, but you can still find Mandarin (Northern Chinese) and Taiwanese speakers as well. Cantonese to Mandarin is probably about 9:1New York: I\'ve only visited NY twice, and from limited experience, New York\'s Chinatowns are more touristy and the food is of less quality than the west coast.Mandarin is the most common Chinese language in NY Chinatown. While I couldn\'t find any statistics, from only my experience, I\'ve encountered more 3rd+ generation (descendants of the first wave of Chinese immigration) Chinese-Americans in New York than I have on the west coast.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 8, 'answer_user': 'William Wai Wong'}, {'answer': 'One thing many might not know about NYC - it actually has 2 "Chinatowns".\xc2\xa0 There is Chinatown in Manhattan, but another in Flushing Queens, which is even larger and more vibrant.\xc2\xa0 In addition, there are pockets of other minor NYC Chinatowns in Sunset Park Brooklyn and Elmhurst Queens.All other "Chinatowns" on the East Coast are very tame in comparison - that is Boston, D.C, etc.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Andy Lemke'}, {'answer': 'A list of US Cities and areas with Chinatowns and/or Chinese populations:California: San FranciscoOaklandSan JoseSeattlePortlandLos AngelesSan DiegoMontereySacramentoStocktonMarysvilleLockeMonterey Park (San Gabriel Valley)New York City (Brooklyn, Flushing, Manhattan)PhiladelphiaBostonWashington D.C.ChicagoSt. LouisBooks: Fortune Cookie Chronicles by Jennifer 8.

Perhaps in your town every attic was a secret brothel or speakeasy, George Washington slept there, or there\'s a ghost of a little girl.A Chinese-American friend of mine is fairly resigned to the myths, and refers to this one as the "burrowing Chinese" stereotype. We Jews play the cello all day long, the Native Americans are honoring their spirit ancestors, and the Chinese are busy digging.Although there aren\'t a lot of secret tunnels around, and probably never have been too many, there are plenty of cool underground things.Not tunnels per se but there were a lot of speakeasies during prohibition, many were underground, and many have been revived in their original location.Many or most old buildings have basement storage rooms that extend under the sidewalk in front of the building, sometimes under the street. These are often connected so they make a tunnel-ish passage.The city used to be full of brothels, still is. Many are historic, some underground.The Old Ship Saloon had a basement and a trap door, something about drugging sailors and selling them to merchant ships. It used to be in an old ship. There are a lot of old ships buried under downtown, they weren\'t so picky about landfill back before the great earthquake, they just piled a bunch of rubble and dirt on top.There are dozens of water cisterns under intersections, built for safety after the 1906 earthquake, and you can recognize their circular brick outlines.The entire Embarcadero and its wide sidewalk is built over what used to be a beach and bay, some of it is still over water if you go to the edge and peer over.Lots of more pedestrian types of tunnels for trains, storm drainage, creeks, water, sewer, utilities, and underground electrical transformers (these explode sometimes, thanks to a rather inept utility company)FWIW a number of neighborhoods were built on old burial grounds or later cemeteries, and the bodies weren\'t always removed.

Throw in decades of tong wars, and it was like taking a stroll through San Quentin or pre-tourism Alcatraz. They likely would have remained hidden longer if not for the 1906 Great Earthquake and Fire. Among other acts of devastation, the fire obliterated Chinatown and uncovered its many deep dwelling places. Today, 96 years after the quake, they are the stuff of legend, their history living on in books, newspaper accounts and oral histories, much of which describe a subterranean world right out of your worst nightmare. "When the high winds blew the ashes away the yawning mouths of tunnels, which the police had long suspected, were revealed," wrote James Russel Wilson in his 1906 book "San Francisco\'s Horror ofEarthquake and Fire." "Entrance to these passages was so carefully hidden that only the leaders of the tongs, who used the damp dungeons for places of meeting or to plot the death of a victim -- the same room often acting as the execution dungeon once the marked man was taken below the level of the street -- knew and declared," he wrote. Despite a wealth of written evidence, many in the Chinese-American community challenge the existence of a complete tunnel network. "A lot of the crime stories of that era were associated with hideouts and tunnels and ways to get in and out," said California Insurance Commissioner Henry Lo, a longtime resident and former judge. "People tripped and fell into holes and described them as tunnels, but any kind of network for sinister purposes was pretty much fiction," he said. Lo is supported by many historians and a first-hand account by Jesse Brown Cook, who served as sergeant of the Chinatown police force until 1906, when he was named the city\'s chief of police. In his memoirs of the area, he wrote: "Perhaps it will surprise you to know that there is no such thing as the underground in Chinatown. True, you could go from one cellar to another, but that is all. In order to deceive the people, the Chinese guides would take them in on Grant Avenue, between California and Sacramento Streets, going down into a cellar. From this they would go downstairs into the next cellar, and so on, sometimes going into six or seven. These basements, however, were all connected with the stores on Sacramento Street." But there are many who favor the urban legend and say that historical records point in their favor. At their longest, according to some, the tunnels stretched all the way through the tiny 16-block enclave and into North Beach. They hid thriving opium dens, torture chambers and Escape Routes that confounded denizens and police for decades. As with the one that still exists in New York\'s Chinatown, the supposed tunnels were unmarked or marked only by signs in Chinese, and connected tong-run gambling houses and theaters upstairs with opium dens and squalid, privately-run debtors prisons down below. Mostly based on drunken, exaggerated retellings from white San Franciscans, The Examiner and other local papers were filled with lurid accounts of gangs of ferocious yellow men leaping up from the tunnels to rape white women, then disappearing back inside. The reality was a lot sadder. One of the main factors in building the underground abodes in The City was to provide Chinese Americans with an escape from their oppressors, the frequently brutal police force. Mayor Eugene Schmitz and attorney Abe Ruef, the power behind the throne, were two of The City\'s most corrupt and racist political figures, and they used their power to try to scare Chinese out of their valuable downtown enclave. But if racist attacks were a fact of life, so were the tong wars, some of which were rekindled as gang wars in the 1970s. As more immigrants settled in The City\'s most densely inhabited square mile, tong wars became increasingly violent. "Hundreds of men went to their deaths each year in Chinatown without an inkling of the tragedies being known to the police," Wilson wrote. The author believed the dead were buried 100 feet deep. "Members of the tongs marked for death left friends behind, men who refused to complain to the local authorities, but who, instead sought revenge themselves in the same fiendish manner that death had been meted out to their fellow-members," he wrote. The darkness ended with the April 18 earthquake and fire. After the dust had cleared, Mayor Schmitz wanted Chinatown relocated to Hunters Point. But China\'s Empress Dowager, just before she died, made clear how much the United States\' largest Chinatown already meant to China and the so-called "Oriental Trade." The Empress Cixi ordered her deputy ambassador in Washington to ride to San Francisco to pressure city fathers into letting Chinatown rebuild, right where it was. Schmitz and other city fathers agreed, with one proviso: no more catacombs. With such a rich history, many San Franciscans prefer the storied fictional past to the more mundane basement theory. Modern tunnel aficionados, many of them teenagers in search of excitement, get their kicks by hanging out in sub-basements, getting drunk in musty storerooms, and breathing in the stench of unused or dried-up sewers. Whether entering Molinari\'s in North Beach, the House of Shields off Market Street, or in the many hidden basements of Chinatown itself, today\'s "tunnels" lead under the physical buildings. The trail inevitably dead-ends at a concrete retaining wall or sewer main, but that does not stop those with a sense of history. If nothing else, walking hunchbacked for miles in search of hidden horrors of the past sure gets the imagination going. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Old Chinatown\'s Deep, Dark Secrets - By Nick Driver Published in The San Francisco Examiner 4/18/2002Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Leon Kitain'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 17, 11, 4), 'tag': ['San Francisco', 'Chinatown (San Francisco neighborhood)', 'Tunnels'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

Also, keep in mind that the larger Chinese restaurants, especially those right off Grant that get a lot of non-Chinese tourists, are known for terrible labor practices and frequent turn-over in staff.\xc2\xa0 Good Chinese chefs either open their own restaurants (Jai Yun) or move around from job to job, looking for a better paying one along the way - and that can be in the burbs.Chinatowns continue to be the first points-of-entry for newly-arrived, impoverished, Asian immigrants.\xc2\xa0 However, the United States - particularly California - experienced a wave of wealthy Chinese after Hong Kong was reabsorbed by China, so in middle-class enclaves (like Daly City, Milbrae or Sunnyvale) you will find Chinese food with more middle-class tastes and wallets in mind.\xc2\xa0 However, is this food indicative of all Chinese food?\xc2\xa0 Considering that the majority of China\'s population are rural peasants or impoverished urban dwellers, no.\xc2\xa0 It is merely ONE kind of Chinese food.Traditional Chinese food is still served in San Francisco\'s Chinatown, but one needs a rudimentary knowledge of Chinese cuisine to know the difference between what one one restaurant is good for as opposed to another.\xc2\xa0 There are restaurants and businesses who specialize in offal, jook, claypot, noodles, dim sum, "dan tat", moon cakes and won ton soup.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot that serve up the sweet and sour pork, the egg foo young, and the honey walnut prawns with mayo.\xc2\xa0 So again, "best" is subjective.Even the American Chinese food has its place and uniqueness there, so there are probably some folks who believe a room full of white people eating rice plates constitutes "bad" Chinese food.\xc2\xa0 Yet, places like Hunan Homes and House of Nanking serve good food.\xc2\xa0 So, in summary, while it may seem like the best Chinese food in the Bay Area isn\'t in Chinatown, that assumption can be right or wrong depending on who is asking the question.*This is actually a Shanghainese, and now Taiwanese, delicacyEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Kevin Weaver'}, {'answer': "In many cities (NYC, LA, SF) the best Chinese food is not in the nominal Chinatown (would love to know if this is the same in other cities as well).\xc2\xa0 My hunch is that this has to do with migration patterns.\xc2\xa0 The original Chinese immigrants settled in what is now known as Chinatown, creating a bustling community.\xc2\xa0 But subsequent waves of immigrants found they needed to move into different areas either because the original was too expensive, croded or something, so they started moving either to outer parts of the city (the Richmond in SF, Flushing in NYC) or to suburbs (Monterey Park et al in LA, Daly City et al in SF) and these areas could hold more people, creating more demand for restaurants. Also, I have a feeling that these areas are wealthier, so they demand higher quality food.\xc2\xa0 Finally, non-chinese folks (aka tourists) kept going to Chinatown for the authentic experience, but they didn't know what was good Chinese food, so the restaurants in Chinatown could go downhill without losing much money.One thing that has happened in SF at least is that the quality of food is increasing in Chinatown (Z&Y, Shanghai Bund to name 2 restaurants), which I think is due to locals learning more about the varied Chinese cuisines and demanding more quality, thus allowing great, regional restaurants to survive in Chinatown.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 8, 'answer_user': 'Andy Katzman'}, {'answer': '"Chinatown" is not really the centre of ethnically Chinese residents in SF, nor the cultural centre of those of Chinese national origin.

If you go to the Wholesale Produce Market near Jack London Square at 5 am, you will see all the Chinatown market owners and/or their employees loading crates of produce into their vans & trucks. The only difference is the labor costs and the profit markup. A major chain supermarket has to pay unionized produce handlers $14 to $25 per hour plus overtime & benefits and still expect to turn a big profit for shareholders. The average pay those elderly immigrant women receive for doing the same work in a Chinatown market is usually below minimum wage with no overtime pay for working 9 to 12 hours a day/ 7 days a week. Some mom & pop Chinatown businesses are able to get away with paying less than the minimum wage because they have arrangements with their employees to pay them a portion of their salary in cash in return for reporting fewer hours than the hours actually worked. Many of these immigrants do not have the language skills to seek employment anywhere else, so they have to go along with it.\xc2\xa0 Chinatown grocery markets also face stiff competition from the all the other Chinatown markets selling the same produce on the same block so they are forced to operate at a substantially slimmer profit margin just to stay in business. Chinese people by nature, are notorious penny-pinchers when it comes to shopping for anything so if you are selling produce and you don't have the absolute lowest prices, you won't survive in Chinatown.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'John Tam'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 10, 1, 15, 25), 'tag': ['Chinatown (San Francisco neighborhood)', 'Food in San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Kate Karas'}

The most significant impact is probably the introduction of Chinese food - restaurant was one of the only businesses Chinese immigrants could do (besides laundry). These restaurants adjusted Chinese recipes to local tastes. Chow mien, for example, was never an authentic Chines dish (at least the way they were cooked in China was very different). After being Americanized, dishes like this ended up popular in America.Embed QuoteVia  Zhenfeng Liu.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Rony Gao'}, {'answer': "In a broader context, Chinatowns have existed in the American mindset as two things: 1. Dens of evil filled with prostitution, drugs, and unsavory characters2. A place to see the exotic, try Chinese food, find firecrackers, a family fun tourist trap.Both ideas exist as places for tourism for the dominant cultural lenses, the first idea culminating from the first Chines communities that built up since the Gold Rush days as most of these communities were built for men. Because of discriminatory laws that did not allow women to immigrate and Chinese men to intermarry (i.e. miscengation laws), this environment was ever more influenced by opium (already in trade by the British) and prostitution. Not all men in Chinatown were like this, the businessmen and those looking toward the future found other ways to start families here.As far as influence, stories in newspaper and fiction that go back to the 1820's illuminate the opium dens and carry onto the modern day in movies like Chinatown, Big Trouble in Little China, and even Rush Hour. In San Francisco, the 1906 earthquake brought with it destruction of the community that lived there. The City of San Francisco had already started plans to move this community to Hunter Point as it sat on prime property neighboring the Financial District. Chinatown leaders, under the vision of a man named Look Tin Eli, fashioned a proposal for Chinatown to stay there, by creating a new community that would be ornately and exotically Chinese. Something designed to bring tourists in and hold onto it's existing location. This worked. Also, because of all of the City Hall's records had been destroyed, Chinese men created new names for themselves and non-existant family members to allow women and children to immigrate, thereby skirting the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This influx of immigration created the Chinatown of the 1900's to 1960's, an Americanized version that is seen in movies like Flower Drum Song. It was in this time that things like Chop Suey was popularized. As a side note, Mahjong was adopted by Jewish ladies of the Lower East Side though I haven't read enough to pinpoint when that happened.Embed QuoteVia  Zhenfeng Liu.Suggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Leonard Shek'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 2, 27, 6, 29), 'tag': ['American (U.S.) Culture, Habits, and Behavior', 'Chinatown (San Francisco neighborhood)', 'This American Life', 'Chinese American Culture', 'Chinese Culture', 'China', 'The United States of America'], 'question_user': 'Zhenfeng Liu'}

It was part of Southern Pacific until well after BART opened, in fact it was not subsidized by the state until 1980.

Santa Clara County had already been ruled out at an earlier stage because they chose to focus on expressway expansion instead of rail transit (bear in mind that San Jose only had 95,000 people in 1950, compared to over ten times that today). The system was not designed to ever be integrated with Caltrain because they were trying to make it the most modern urban commuter rail transit system in the world at the time. BART uses completely different technology, including an electric third rail and a different track gauge and was originally designed to be automated. Caltrain uses traditional diesel locomotives on standard gauge tracks (like an Amtrak train) because it has simply evolved from the passenger line that has been in place there since the 1800s.

It\'s clear that in this context, it isn\'t being used in the sense of "Do I need to breathe" or even "Do I need to exercise" but rather, "Will I have a significantly diminished quality of life if I don\'t have a car?"To answer THAT question, I\'d have to say that keeping a car in the city improves your life but costs a decent, but not outrageous, amount of money. I would recommend keeping a car if you can afford it, and, to an extent, would trade off other things like apartment size and location to have a car. A car really lets you get around the city with a facility that public transportation does not offer. For example, yesterday my girlfriend and I popped over to the Mission from SOMA (10 minute drive), parked at the 21st and Valencia garage ($2), and picked up hot chocolate and Lucca\'s ravioli for dinner. That trip took about 25 minutes, and would have taken 90 minutes by MUNI which means it wouldn\'t have happened. I wouldn\'t have done it with Zipcar either, since it would have cost me $13.Having a car, I\'m much more likely to "pop over" or "swing by" things, catch a beignet at Brenda\'s on the way back from a friend\'s house in the Marina, go to Ton Kiang for dim sum instead of the place near my house, catch half an hour of a cool circus performance, etc. And while parking is challenging it\'s usually an under-5 minute job.San Francisco is not Manhattan and it is not Los Angeles. In Manhattan, owning a car is basically pointless -- traffic, parking, and costs will bankrupt you, and the public transit system is so outstandingly good that you\'ll never want a car. In Los Angeles, of course, car nonownership is a severe handicap. San Francisco is in between the two -- you don\'t need a car, but it will be a really nice thing to have.It costs me $200 a month for parking, $50 a month in insurance, and $150 a month in car operating costs (fuel + maintenance + depreciation). Taking out about the $150 a month I would spend on cab and MUNI fares (going to many fewer places than I do now), it costs me about $250 a month to keep a car in the city, but I\'d gladly trim $250 off my apartment costs than get rid of my car.Gotta go -- picking up my girlfriend in Bernal Heights!Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 13, 'answer_user': 'Marc Bodnick'}, {'answer': 'There is no need for a car if you are living in Mission and working in downtown.

I took Caltrain all the way to San Francisco and then walk the final 0.9 miles. The monthly pass was $179.Northbound, there are 6 bullets a morning from Palo Alto. They take 37 or 39 minutes. Then it takes me about 18 minutes to walk from the Caltrain station to Mission and 5th. So the total commute time (from Caltrain arriving to sitting at my desk) was 55 minutes to one hour.Leaving Caltrain, I walked down Townsend towards Fifth, then took Fifth the whole way. This is quicker than walking down Fourth, even though Fourth is nicer. (It's not legal to walk across the 80 onramp at 4th & Harrison - so if you walk Fourth for much of the way to Mission, you have to cross to the northeast side of Fourth - which is away from your final destination.) Comparing the alternatives:Caltrain + Muni:Public transit from Caltrain to 5th and Mission isn't quick or straightforward - Google Maps says the fastest Public Transit option from Caltrain to Fifth and Mission is taking the 47 from Caltrain to Fifth and Harrison - then walking the final 0.4 miles. ($2 for saving at most 7 minutes and a half mile of walking is below my value threshold. And that time savings is only if you nail the connection.) To minimize walking, they recommend either the 45 (16 total minutes, have to walk from 3rd and Mission to 5th and Mission) or the N (18 total minutes - literally no time savings). Heading to Caltrain, however, both the 30 and the 45 stop at Fifth and Howard and Fifth and Market and bring you right to Caltrain. According to Google Maps, that makes it about 9 minutes from Fifth and Mission to Caltrain.Caltrain + BART:Caltrain takes about 15 minutes, on a bullet, from Millbrae to the SF 4th & King Caltrain station. With walking, that's about 33-35 minutes from Millbrae to 5th and Mission. BART takes 29 minutes, plus then a few minutes of walking, from Millbrae to the Powell station (the closest BART station to 925 Mission).

One, noted by Mike Hamilton, is that they change the train to try and "balance" the service levels (even though it seems like the levels are still unbalanced). NextMuni thinks there will be an L but they change it to a J or whatever.Second is that the computer voice announcements are based solely on the ATCS software. That system thinks that a train at Powell going inbound will reach Embarcadero in 3 minutes and then turn around in 2 minutes to be outbound.\xc2\xa0 It does not take into account how slow other trains are going, whether the operator will take a bathroom break, etc. This is why it can say Outbound M in 5 minutes at Montgomery but it really takes 8 or more.The NextMuni system is used to feed those large monitors in each of the stations.\xc2\xa0 This is a separate GPS system which predicts travel times based on a combination of schedule, historical data and analysis of current conditions. It can be very accurate in typical situations, but GPS doesn\'t work in the subway so NextMuni has to "guess" more. Note at Embarcadero there are two displays. One shows the typical NextMuni with map and prediction times and the other shows the raw feed from the ATCS display. That raw map can be really helpful in figuring out congestion, problems, etc.Finally, some trains are stored at a yard along the T line and come into service. They will show as N or K until they get into the ATCS entrance near Folsom and then change to the actual letter.

Poor maintenance in the 20th century led to a further decline.\xc2\xa0 Balkanization of the regional transportation system prevented effective growth.SF has a very high population density of 17,200 persons/sq.mi and is only exceeded by NYC at 26,000 persons/sq.mi.\xc2\xa0 The geography and geology isn't easy, but it was over come with cable cars long ago and NYC's geology isn't completely trivial either.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where SF does have a disadvantage is that its population is low, only 800,000 and its work force has a large fraction of commuters (I couldn't find the exact number but I'd guess around 300,000 per day).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally there\xc2\xa0 is history.As has been pointed out, SF had a functional cable car system operating before the 1906 earthquake.\xc2\xa0 The system had more lines that what it has now.\xc2\xa0 SF had a population of 300,000 at the time\xc2\xa0 and was in the top 10 most populous US cities (SF has only grown 150% in the intervening century).\xc2\xa0 So there was plenty of motivation to build an effective public transportation system at the same time that NYC and Boston were building theirs.The 1906 earthquake destroyed the system and bickering\xc2\xa0 prevented it from being effectively rebuilt.\xc2\xa0 Even before the earthquake, the United Railroads of San Francisco had been trying to change the cable car system to overhead system and in the aftermath, the system became MUNI.\xc2\xa0 During the middle portion of the 20th century, MUNI and the remaining cable car system severely deteriorated due to a lack of maintenance and generally dysfunctional politics.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was during the time of car dominance and many US cities ripped up their street car lines.There were numerous political decisions taken in the intervening decades that weakened the public transportation systems.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Notably amongst these decisions was the creation of roughly 40 different regional transportation agencies, e.g. BART (1957) and CalTrain (1977).\xc2\xa0 Instead of creating a coherent system integrated with MUNI, these are stand-alone systems that do not connect smoothly with each other creating expensive, slow systems that motivate many people to drive into SF rather than take a public transportation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San...http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/hi...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 10, 'answer_user': 'Jay Wacker'}, {'answer': 'NY subway was built when safety concerns were minimal, and when human life was "cheap" - plenty of people died while building the NY subway.SF got started as a city much later, and the population density didn\'t warrant building a subway until after World War II, and by then it became exponentially more expensive to build anything for all the above-mentioned reasons, plus safety requirements have risen dramatically as well.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Toli Kuznets'}, {'answer': 'In terms of public transportation, you cannot compare New York to any other city in the US.\xc2\xa0 With 26,000 people per square mile, NYC is by far and away the densest city in the country.\xc2\xa0 Plus this density is spread out over a relatively large area, when you consider even Brooklyn, Queens, and Bronx are extremely dense for American urban districts.\xc2\xa0 THE most important variable for effective transportation is population densities.\xc2\xa0 This is why public transit works better in Boston than Atlanta, even though the Atlanta metro area is more populous.\xc2\xa0 San Fransisco itself is quite dense, but the density is not even half of that of NYC.\xc2\xa0 There certainly are other figures in the equation, but the simple answer to why NYC public transit is so good lies within population density.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Benjamin Ross'}, {'answer': "Started too late.

The goal of the report is to plan the future of housing, land use, transportation, environment, and the built environment in the San Francisco Bay Area. In order to encourage more environmentally & economically sustainable urban environments, the MTC identified in the map above - in purple - where future housing and mixed-used development should have high priority in the next 20-30 years.In other words, instead of driving far away from your house to work, why not live, work, and play, next to a transit hub?These are known as transit-oriented developments, which are medium to high density developments (residential, commercial, industrial, civic, green space, etc.). The second picture above actually is a transit oriented development being built of the Pleasant Hill BART Station in the East Bay.The goal is to minimize the (environmental/economic) cost of transportation for families and commuters, as well as reduce the need of suburban sprawl.In addition, the San Francisco Bay Area population is growing!As of 2011, the population is 7.15 million people. [2] Conflicting studies show that the population could go anywhere from 8.4 million to 9.5 million by 2040 [3]. Given the high cost of building highway infrastructure, as well as limited land space, transportation and city planners are focusing on ways to create more transit-friendly environments that is convenient for living, working, and playing.Given the high cost of living in the City & County of San Francisco, this sort of planning is actually beneficial for San Francisco; given SF\'s limited space, SF\'s neighbors in the East Bay can alleviate some of its housing pain.

The average local train had 294 people. Those trains tend to be the ones that run outside of rush hours, virtually none run during the highest peak times (the other train type is called "limited" and at 564 people on average is closer to "baby bullet" ridership.)The midnight Saturday is a very "average" train, with 303 people on board. That makes it less than half full.Because Caltrain stations are most self service, it\'s probably not the case that baby bullet trains are significantly cheaper to operate than local trains, but there would be some considerations with a nighttime baby bullet.By not stopping everywhere, it would only be useful to people who were willing to wind up at a few stations. That would limit ridership.The limited stops would make ticket checking easier and would likely keep compliance costs low.Unless you run one train in each direction, you have a problem. You\'d have to return the train to the opposite end in time for the next morning\'s run. There aren\'t a supply of extra trains such that you could keep on running a train south over and over every Friday and Saturday without also running a train north at some corresponding time (before Monday morning) to balance things out. This would add cost, unless that run was also profitable.It\'s pretty likely that most of those off-peak trains do not cover the operating cost of running them and that without the full rush-hour trains Caltrain would be perpetually in the red. How far in the red? Well that\'s where it gets harder to tell. Given that off-peak trains have lower fares and lower occupancy, they are probably running at a deficit of a couple thousand dollars per run, but precisely what those numbers are, I cannot say. My very crude guesstimate is that an extra baby bullet, southbound-only, on Friday and Saturday nights would cost Caltrain $500K per year.[1]Page on caltrain.comEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Mark Rogowsky'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 13, 18, 46), 'tag': ['San Francisco Public Transportation', 'Caltrain', 'Trains', 'San Francisco Bay Area'], 'question_user': "Adam D'Angelo"}

If you're heading north into San Francisco, I recommend just taking BART (it depends on where you're going, but there's few places I'd recommend transferring from BART to Caltrain to head to San Francisco).Before about 7pm on work weekdays, you need to take BART north from SFO to San Bruno, and then south from San Bruno to Millbrae.

First, San Francisco is indeed planning to increase the size of its underground transit system.San Francisco Municipal RailwayThe reason why it hasn't grown faster and farther is, indeed, density. It's extremely expensive to build a subway system, and it only makes sense if lots of people use it. The people who use it the most are the ones living close to the stations. The only way to have lots of people living close to a station is to have high buildings. However, San Francisco took the decision a long time ago to limit the height of its buildings. Less height, less density, less users, less tickets, less revenue for the subway, and less money to finance the expensive construction.Most other cities that have grown vertically (New York, most European and Asian capitals) have underground systems that are much more developed.The height limits in San Francisco are changing, especially in the SoMA area.

If you work in SoMa and live in the Mission, you can get away with a single speed or fixie since you don't need to go up hill. (Single speeds are very easy on maintenance, and don't get messed up badly on Caltrain.)Many people will want gears.

You'll find varying opinions on how awesome helmets are, but I like helmets. I recommend rain over-pants and a hooded rain-jacket for the rainy months. Clear glasses can be nice to keep rain from going in your eyes. Don't forget lights and reflectors. Bright lights cause drivers to respect you more and give more passing distance. Reflectors can be brighter than lights, depending on the light source, and when they're moving (either on wheels or ankles/pedals), they are impossible to mistake as a fixed object. (When a car is going 45 miles an hour, a fixed-height reflector can be mistaken at a distance for a fixed obstacle. Reflectors that move up and down are unmistakable and give increased safety.)I also highly recommend taking something like the SF Bike Coalition's Safety Classes. Lots of safety tips for cyclists are not obvious. When to take the road, what to watch out for, etc make a big difference in safety. The League of American Bicyclists organizes similar classes.

The Mission has amazing food (not just Mexican but do try a Mission Burrito while here), beautiful murals and lots of great small shops, stores and cafes. Hayes Valley is a small stretch of great unique stores and fantastic restaurants. South Park in SOMA is the heart of the SF tech community (and was the heart of the 1990\'s Internet bubble). The Ferry Building has great farmers markets on Tues, Thurs and Saturday as well as a 7 day a week fantastic collection of food stores and restaurants - and isn\'t just a tourist attraction local shop there every day as well.Other things to consider doing which do not require a car:- rent a bike and bike to and across the Golden Gate Bridge- take the ferry - to Sausalito would be my suggestion though other options would be to Angel Island or Alcatraz. Beautiful and inexpensive though you do have to pay attention to the schedule. - take the BART to the East Bay and go spend a day in Berkeley and/or explore neighborhoods of Oakland such as Rockridge or downtown and see a film at the classic Grand Lake theater.- take the Muni to the Castro, see a film at the amazing Castro theater, explore the heart of SF\'s gay community (though plenty of folks who are not gay such as myself spend a lot of time in the area as well) and enjoy the many great dining (and shopping and nightlife options). I\'m particularly fond of Zadin for dinner (full disclosure - the owners are high school friends of my girlfriend though I loved and recommended the restaurant before she and I were dating) - enjoy SF\'s amazing coffee culture - I\'ve posted elsewhere on Quora my long (and I do mean long) list of coffee options but basically DO NOT drink Pete\'s or Starbucks coffee while you are in SF, instead enjoy the amazing local cafes and roasters - Blue Bottle (especially their Mint St location which is among my favorite suggestions for breakfast downtown), Sightglass (on 7th & Folsom - a great option if your hotel is along 7th), Ritual in the Mission on Valencia, The Summit and Four Barrel also along Valencia (The Summit is also the home of I/O Ventures a new tech startup incubator). Coffee Bar in the Potrero neighborhood is fantastic and has great food - and the neighborhood is one few tourists see. Be flexible in the restaurants you dine in - avoid any national (or for that matter local) chains and instead make reservations at local restaurants or select a neighborhood such as Hayes Valley, The MIssion etc and just pick a place that has good reviews and availability for your group that evening - though if you have the time and patience I would suggest trying for places that might be a bit hard to get into (which in SF is usually a good thing). Flour + Water in the MIssion for example is amazing and though they take a few reservations each evening they also keep a number of tables which are available first come first served - i.e. you will want to get there before they open for dinner that evening and line up - well worth it. But classic SF restaurants such a Zuni Cafe are also well worth trying and perhaps slightly easier to get into (they serve both lunch and dinner - both are excellent)And a final suggestion - DO BUY a MUNI FASTPASS. Muni sells tourist "passports" which will give you unlimited rides for 1, 3 or 7 days. Buy one and use it - this makes it easier for you to just hop on and off the muni without worrying about transfer times or having enough exact change. You can buy these at SFO or at the Muni kiosk at Powell & Market (and I think the Muni stores in the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations, your hotel likely can also help you here).There are a lot of tourist attractions and places to go see (and restaurants concierges will likely suggest - such as Sears Fine Foods) For the most part I would suggest minimizing your time in those places. Coit Tower is fun to walk up, Union Square is worth a quick visit but for me the real attractions SF are in the neighborhoods - the Painted Ladies of Alamo Sq, the beauty of the waterfront and Ocean Beach etc. Golden Gate park is worth a visit, though personally I would skip the de Young Museum (the Academy of Sciences however I\'ve heard is very good).have fun, hope this was/is helpful.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Shannon John Clark'}, {'answer': "I have been 3 times to SF and only rented a car for 2 days the last time (which I used to head over to the Petaluma/Santa Rosa area and back).

Super Shuttle is a good service but you have to be pretty accurate when you talk with them - I've know people to take Super Shuttle for a morning flight only to arrive too late to board due to cutting things too closely. Very early in the morning you can occasionally luck out and be the only passenger for Super Shuttle. If your plans are highly flexible an option to consider might be to see about switching to a hotel very near the airport the evening before your flight - that might either offer you a free shuttle to the airport from the hotel or at a minimum a low cost cab ride to the airport (this is basically shifting your transportation challenge to the day before your flight leaves - but might be worth considering)Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Shannon John Clark'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 25, 3, 26), 'tag': ['San Francisco Transportation', 'San Francisco Public Transportation', 'San Francisco International Airport (SFO)', 'BART'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

This is a somewhat haphazard list of observations on personal experience public transportation here and in several other places I've visited. I have never taken public transportation to the San Francisco airport from Santa Clara. It does not run that early, or that late, and the trip would mean taking something (friend? taxi? bus? 2-mile walk?) to the Caltrain station, to Bart. Of course, if it's the airport, chances are I need to arrive at 5am, which wouldn't be much fun to increase by 2 hours, even if trains did run at those times.At a minimum, Caltrain could, and should, add some means to buy the Bart transfer to SFO, or simply include it for passengers getting off there. Better yet, Caltrain and Bart would connect at both ends and adopt a single, simplified ticketing system. Even if they remain under the direction of separate agencies, passengers could choose a destination (or buy an all-day pass), pay once, and let the agencies' computers sort out the final tallies. When that part is working smoothly, throw in the local buses that get people to their final destinations.Many people here don't take public transportation regularly. Any simplification that would help the occasional passenger (visitors from out of the area, people heading to an event in San Francisco, etc.) would probably have a positive impact on regular ridership, too.In all the places I've traveled outside the U.S., there was no need to have a car.Public transportation in Sweden, even the rural parts, is extremely well coordinated. I don't mean merely pretty timetables. I mean that buses and trains leave when they should (both on time and at times that are convenient). They also know coordinate about how different parts of the system time to one another. That is, if a train is going to arrive late for some reason, the bus driver on the connecting route will hear about this and wait for the train. One ticket (typically an RFID card for regular passengers, or a bar code would do) scans you into the system, with a scanner on the bus or train for all connections. They seem to be very concerned with both reliability and safety, and actively remove from service older vehicles and trains that no longer serve current standards.On the other end of the economic spectrum, La Paz, Bolivia runs on a system of minibuses (basically, largish vans with extra seating and little cargo space). They're operated by individuals or small companies, who get permits from the city to run a wide assortment of routes. They're inexpensive, and if you know which one to hop into, you can get from pretty much anywhere in or around the city to pretty much anywhere else. I don't expect any 20 Americans would gladly get quite that cozy, but they seem to be a good solution for La Paz, which has older, narrower streets, limited economic means, and lots of districts full of smaller side streets. One nice thing about many smaller vehicles like this is that they tend to get closer to both ends of any given journey.Somewhere in between, Buenos Aires, Argentina has an excellent, efficient subway system with connections to regional trains for elsewhere in the area and a system of full-sized buses run by colectivos. It's possible to get close to just about any part of the city in fairly short order on a subway ticket that costs about 35 U.S. cents.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Betsy Megas'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 10, 21, 0, 16), 'tag': ['San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Bruno, CA', 'Santa Clara County, CA', 'Santa Clara, CA', 'San Mateo, CA', 'San Francisco Public Transportation', 'Sunnyvale, CA', 'BART', 'Menlo Park, CA', 'Peninsula (Bay Area)', 'Public Transport', 'Caltrain', 'San Jose, CA', 'Mountain View, CA', 'Palo Alto, CA', 'Civil Engineering', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Alan Nguyen'}

First of all, many of the places will have free entrance if you RSVP online, typically requiring you to be there before 10:30-11pm. In general - check sfstation.com, and you can follow those places on twitter / facebook for their promos / free events if you dont mind the extra noise.Case in point - Temple (templesf.com) comes to mind, over at SOMA, nice house/dubstep parties and always fun hiphop downstairs. 2. All-around good fun in more dive-ish / mission-hipster-esque atmosphere, usually old school hiphop, 80ies hits and such - Beauty Bar at the Mission (Mission and 19th). Extra points for having Taqueria Cancun across the street. Kinda gets old fast I feel like, but you can get some mile-age out of it :)3. If you're more into mixed crowd (LGBT or just gay-friendly), you can try Qbar and Trigger around Castro / Market. Tuesdays are ladies night (read: lesbian), but if you're not acting all douchie you can just enjoy really great dance/pop mixes in a super cheerful, colorful atmosphere, always packed to the brim and great vibe.4. Madrone art bar - over around Divisadero and Fell (NOPA), hip art bar that has some great dj/live music. I especially like Tuesday nights, live funk/boogaloo band there - really great musicians, goes on until pretty late too. Usually no cover or very cheap one if at all.5. Matrix fillmore at the Marina - lounge/bar with decent music most of the time, check out their calendar for whats free or not. Marina crowd.6. Folsom & 11th St. area - DNA Lounge, Slim's, Holy Cow, WiSH - lots of places around there, mostly cheap covers or no cover at all, but really depends on day of the week / who's playing.

{'qid': 136, 'ans_num': 6, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85What's a good bar in SF for a bootstrapped startup to throw a launch party on the cheap?", 'answers': [{'answer': "Actually, more often than not, venues in San Francisco will give you the space for free if you can guarantee a minimum amount of people (the amount differs on the venue) or guarantee a minimum in liquor sales (the amount differs depending on the night as well as on the venue). In fact, this works even better if you throw a party on a traditionally slow night (ie \xe2\x80\x93 Sunday, Monday or Tuesday). I would definitely recommend not throwing a party any place where you have to pay for the space since you're bringing them liquor sales for the evening without them having to lift a finger. Keep in mind, party promoters get paid by venues to perform essentially the same function.The first thing to do if you're looking for specific venues is to figure out roughly how many people you expect to show up; that will determine the venue you should go with. If you're going for under 75 people that will change your options versus having a launch party with over 150 people. Here are some venues to look at (I put in venues of different sizes because I don't know what you're looking for):* Oz Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/oz-loung...) \xe2\x80\x93 They only serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They do not serve shots. Their capacity is about 60 people and they have excellent food if you want to class it up for cheap. This is more of a lounge vibe. If you ask them nicely, they'll even get a jazz band to play for your party for cheap. Or they can also bring in a DJ.* Sugar Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-ca...) \xe2\x80\x93 They have a full bar and will serve all kinds of liquor. They also have two different closed off areas for private parties, if you'd like. They also serve excellent food and if you get the whole place to yourself their capacity is about 150 (but I wouldn't go over 100 with them otherwise things can get uncomfortable at the bar). They don't have a license for live music, so they play music off an iPod (you can bring in your own if you want them to use that). This is also a lounge vibe.* The Cellar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cell...) \xe2\x80\x93 This is right next door to Sugar and it's more of a club vibe than a lounge vibe. They have two different rooms and their capacity can easily hit about 200 (comfortably). With their recent renovations it's gotten really classy, but the drinks are still really cheap. They have two rooms and they are often willing to give you the smaller room (~50 person capacity) if you just want that.* Mah-velous (http://sfluxe.com/2010/11/03/sim...) \xe2\x80\x93 These guys are so new they don't even have a Yelp page yet, but they are actively looking to get the word out about themselves. They're strictly a coffee and wine bar and their capacity is comfortably about 30; but it's a dope little venue. For a wine bar, their prices are pretty inexpensive. If you're looking for a smaller launch party, but classy (and relatively inexpensive), this could be an option.* Blur (http://www.yelp.com/biz/blur-san...) \xe2\x80\x93 This is a nice little bar on Polk Street. They have a full bar and their bartenders are really cool. They have a comfortable capacity of about 60, but it's a really cool spot.* Impala (http://www.yelp.com/biz/impala-s...) \xe2\x80\x93 While the Yelp reviews are mediocre, it's under new ownership as of December and the new guy is really working on making some serious changes. If you're going to throw a party there you can get the downstairs/VIP room to yourself and it comfortably fits about 100 people. They also have one of the best bartenders in the city (he's a trained mixologist). They serve some pretty solid Mexican food and they can make some stuff for your party as well.* The Parlor (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-parl...) \xe2\x80\x93 This place has been doing a good job of reaching out to tech companies in recent days, so I'd take a look at it. It's in Fisherman's Wharf, but don't let that stop you. They have three full bars in the venue and they can fit well over 300 people comfortably.Ok. I'm going to stop writing a book now.

The spaces are all very open and lounge-y feeling.Otis (http://venuetastic.com/venues/ot...)Otis also has two floors, with what feels like much smaller, more intimate spaces upstairs for private conversations.Rye (http://venuetastic.com/venues/ry...)Is partitioned and very airy - there are vague sections, but the layout is much more open than, say, Otis.An additional advantage to these spaces is that they\'ve both got tons of personality without much work on your part, so these are great options if you\'re looking for a unique space and an interesting feel.Embed QuoteVia  Jeremy Richardson.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 11, 'answer_user': 'Christine Yen'}, {'answer': '111 Minna is good. Gallery space with a stage for music, plenty of projector real estate, 2 bars, 2 rooms. B Restaurant and Bar in Yerba Buena is beautiful, they have a lot of neat packages, if you are looking to do branding they have a lot of capabilities with all glass walls. Not good if you want multiple rooms or projector though, but with a group that\'s only 150 you might want a place that feels a little cozier than getting too spread out. Box SF is literally just an "event space." It\'s beautiful, but is pricey, has a lot of build outs and customizations that need to take place. But it is targeted exactly for that business size.The best deal I\'ve found is House of Shields on New Montgomery just across from the Palace Hotel. Lots of character (think speakeasy style). Very accommodating. Excellent business to work with. And they\'ll do an open bar without liquor restrictions. They\'ll help you customize a branded menu. And they do their own catering of pretty delicious appetizers. There\'s a cool bar space on 3rd and Townsend, not sure what the deal with it is, currently unused, but I went to a very well done Hendricks Gin event there.

Have you considered hiring a Destination Management Company or Event Production Company? You may think that hiring someone to help you with planning and logistics will just add cost, but you'd be surprised how much a DMC can help you save money by getting the best quotes from reputable vendors (they have purchasing clout, because they hire them all the time) and they can use their experience to help you avoid costly mistakes. It's sort of like you might be able to replace the brakes on your car to save money, but only if you value your own time very little, because a professional mechanic can do it much faster and not break anything in the process.If you'd like to search for a DMC, check out:http://eventrfp.com/Destination/...(this will also give you a dashboard for sending RFPs and keeping track of responses) orhttp://www.adme.org/dmc/members....This is the directory for the big trade organization for DMCs.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'David Adams'}, {'answer': 'Renting a club like Mezzanine, Mighty or Temple is probably a good bet.

I think August Capital had a party there. Other grand historic rooms include the City Club (www.cityclubsf.com) and my favorite, the Julia Morgan Ballroom (julia morgan ballroom). The Marines Memorial has a beautiful room up top (please forgive their cheesy pictures www.marineclub.com/groups.php).Some other high places with views - you can rent out the Top of the Mark (www.intercontinentalmarkhopkins.com/top_of_the_mark/) or the Starlight Room (www.harrydenton.com/index.php?page=private). The most spectacular is probably the top floor ballroom at the St. Francis (skip the lower floor ballrooms) - www.westinstfrancis.com/weddings-social-events/.Terra Gallery (that's where the first SF Quora user party was last year). I'm only so-so on this one, as it takes a lot of work to decorate it nicelyYerba Buena Center for the Arts - Yelp had its Christmas party there once. http://www.ybca.org/rentals/venu....SF Moma, the convention room www.sfmoma.org/about/facility_rentals/facility_rentals_policies. Museums can be cool... you could do it at the California Academy and party under the dinosaurs, www.calacademy.org/visit/plan_an_event/.If you want to be extra classy, the St. Regis and the Intercontinental (the Convention Center one, not the Mark Hopkins) both do parties very well.\xc2\xa0 For a different vibe consider Clift Hotel. When you do it at a hotel you can rent a hospitality suite upstairs for an afterparty / private reception room kind of thing, and also rooms for any visiting investors, dignitaries, etc. Some hotels like the Westin or Four Seasons can do an outdoor tent, which is kind of fun.A number of nightclubs are in that size range: Infusion Lounge (http://infusionlounge.com/), Slide (http://slidesf.com/), Temple (www.templesf.com/), Mezzanine (www.mezzaninesf.com/private_events.asp), Slim's (www.slims-sf.com/fr-PrivateEvents.html), DNA Lounge (www.dnalounge.com/booking/)Ruby Skye - may be too big, http://www.rubyskye.com/index1.h...111 Minna is a classic.

The two rooms (one is significantly larger than the other) have very different environments (one has a full stage / the other has a bar), which are perfect for setting up different dynamics (give a speech in one room / have the socializing in the other room)3. The venue is not bare. There is constantly shifting art displayed (unlike Mezzanine or Mighty)4. They also have several projectors available for use5.

This is my own ranking based on convenience for driving, parking, accessibility, nightlife and how the commute is.1) SOMA - The nice parts to live in are south of Harrison and between 2nd and 5th. Areas between 5th and 10th get a little sketchier with the amount of homeless shelters and dimly lit streets in the area. SOMA has easy access to 280 if you're driving. From most parts of SOMA, you can walk to the Caltrain station pretty easily. Parking is okay, but most condos have a place for you to rent a spot for $150-300/month. The Avalon apartment complexes are pretty much full of young professionals in their 20s. Not too much local nightlife other than 330 Ritch. But it's easy to catch a cab and get to any part of the city for $7-$15.2) Mission - Very lively; you can walk anywhere and everywhere and find bars and restaurants. Dolores Park on summer weekends is awesome and there are tons of bars and lounges around: 16th and Guerrero, Valencia, and Mission between 18th and 22nd. Stay away from the 16th/Mission and 24th/Mission Bart Stations. It's as the Brits would say, dodgy, at times. Also, there's known to be a few muggings and robberies targeting Google and Apple shuttle commuters. Parking here is okay, but I recommend parking west (or up the hill) of Valencia, the closer you get to Mission the greater likelihood your car will be broken-in to.3) Russian Hill/Nob Hill - Great area, very safe (more so Russian Hill). Tons of bars up and down Polk Street for a mile until you reach the Tenderloin/Civic Center. Parking is horrendous though and requires a city permit if you want to leave your car there during the day. I used to spend on average of 10-20 minutes to find parking and I would consider 5 blocks away as close. The drive to the freeway in the morning isn't bad -- just take either Polk or Gough straight to the 101/280. Restaurants are in the $$$ range but all 4 star+ no matter what guide you use. The restaurants in the Russian Hill area are more candle lit date spots than a place to grab a bite with your buddies.4) Noe Valley - I live here now. Parking is easy, the 280 entrance is right around the corner. But not much to do in regards to 21+ scene. Mostly newlyweds and new parents in the area. The Mission and Castro are close, but they're not quite walking distance due to all the hills.Other notes: Also, this is a funny cartoon to get the general sense of the people by neighborhood. San Francisco Neighborhood map by Bikes (http://sconnolly.net/wp-content/...)Marina and North Beach are great areas but it's tough to commute to Mountain View.

Caltrain from SF to MV is 45-60min depending on whether you\'re on a "local" or "baby bullet" (i.e. "express"), and relying on any other form of public transit to get to/from Caltrain\'s going to give you a 1.5hr (good day) to 2hr (bad day) commute.

However in College my focus was cheap, free refills, and a good working environment, I was less concerned that the coffee was really high quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I was always passionate about local, independent cafes and while I lived in Chicago I grew to know and love many great small local cafes, spending most of my time in the ones that had great atmospheres and great coffee. Including among these was the amazingly high quality\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Inteligentsia Coffee which I was a customer of from their first cafe which opened up in Boystown and then later their locations downtown in the Loop. In the years since they have expanded to a cafe in LA and are among the growing Third Wave of cafes and local coffee roasters which have spread the serious coffee movement throughout the US and indeed around the globe.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have now lived in the Bay Area for 3 1/2 years, in this time I have seen an explosion of great coffee roasters and cafes, led by a group of local coffee roasters and a growing and large coffee culture here in San Francisco. In this post I will write up some of my current favorite cafes in San Francisco, from time to time I will update this post as new places open or old places close.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a frequent cafe customer I look for a few things in cafes I frequent on a regular basis.Great coffee. This should perhaps go without saying, but it makes a huge difference. There are some cafes whose space & location I love, but which I rarely frequent because the coffee does not match the space.Big tables. I have a theory of cafes. Small tables (think the tiny bistro tables of the traditional French cafe) make it hard to share a table with a stranger and make working on laptops awkward. My favorite cafes have always been the ones with large, oversized tables that promote sharing tables with strangers and allow for easy working with laptops.Free Wifi & Power. Though here I am will to make exceptions. Serious coffee trumps wifi \xe2\x80\x93 I just use my time in those cafes in different ways \xe2\x80\x93 for conversations, for time to catch up on my reading, for time to write offline. Later this year I expect I will have a portable data card (or tether my iPhone 3GS) so wifi will be less of an issue. Power too is easy to work around and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst thing to get up and move after 4+ hours in front of my laptop.Happy employees. The best cafes have happy, passionate employees. Employess who are treated well, who do their work with attention to detail and passion for quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other factors I look for in great cafes. Good food is always welcome especially if locally sourced. And being open late fits my lifestyle well. Thankfully in San Francisco I have many options.My not so short list of great cafes in San Francisco:Blue Bottle The coffee of choice for most of the top chefs in the Bay Area. Blue Bottle is one the best coffee roasters I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever tasted and their cafes are among the finest I know of anywhere in the world. It all started with their Kiosk in Hayes Valley at 315 Linden St and at the Ferry Building Farmer\xe2\x80\x99s Markets. Now they have an amazing new space at 66 Mint St, a full cafe inside of the Ferry Building and a new location in the rooftop garden of the SF MOMA. At their full cafe on Mint in addition to great coffee prepared with serious attention to detail and more methods of preparation than any other cafe I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, they also have a small but great selection of food options which change during the course of the day. No wifi, but one of my favorite spots for business meetings, especially around conferences at the nearby Moscone Center.Ritual Coffee Roasters. Ritual is rapidly overflowing their storefront location at 1026 Valencia St in the Mission where they removed couches and many tables to make room for their roaster and coffee storage in the back. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have any power outlets, but still manage to almost always have full tables and a line for their fantastic coffee. With only a small selection of food (albiet tasty baked goods) Ritual is a destination for coffee drinking and a spot where many people sit and work. I\xe2\x80\x99m the Foursquare mayor of Ritual on Valencia as a result of my many times a week visits. Ritual also has a smaller cafe inside of Flora Grub Gardens in Bayview at 1634 Jerrold Ave and a new cafe inside of the Oxbow Public Market at 610 First St in Napa. Ritual coffees are served by many great restaurants and cafes as well.Four Barrel Coffee Before they opened their well designed space at 375 Valencia St which features a large onsite coffee roaster and furniture built from reclaimed lumber, Four Barrel served coffee from the rear of their space via a kiosk open to the small alleyway. Founded by serious coffee people, Four Barrel is an example of a cafe that is all about the coffee, they have only a few baked goods and do not have wifi, yet are usually full until closing. They have a few wholesale customers here in SF and are a fantastic addition to the local coffee scene.Epicenter Cafe Another new addition to San Francisco, Epicenter Cafe is located at 764 Harrison. They are not a coffee roaster but take coffee and food very seriously. Their beans are from Barefoot Coffee Roasters in Santa Clara (who also provide coffee to Google \xe2\x80\x93 a company that takes food and drink fairly seriously). The coffee here is fantastic, what I love about the cafe is the space, high quality food, lots of tables, power outlets and free wifi. It is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in SOMA to work and have meetings.Coffee Bar \xe2\x80\x93 Probably my favorite overall cafe in San FranciscoCoffee Bar is located at the corner of Mariposa & Florida in Potrero Hill. The coffee here is from Mr Espresso in Oakland (one of the owners is part of the family that runs Mr Espresso) and is prepared with great attention to detail both as espresso shots or on their reasonably priced Clover machines. But it is the space and food which is why I so love Coffee Bar. They have a great menu of food and drinks including wine and beer and a multi-leveled space which has been designed with great attention to detail. They have a long bar with underbar power outlets perfect for working alone as well as many oversized tables perfect for groups or for sharing with others. On Thursdays and Fridays they turn the kitchen over to Radio Africa Kitchen which offers some of the best food in San Francisco at extremely reasonable prices. I find the location, food, and ambiance combine to make Coffee Bar one of my favorite cafes and a highly productive space either for working on my laptop or for having great business meetings.Philz coffee is a family run establishment here in San Francisco which has been expanding rapidly in the last few years, going from just a few locations when I first moved here to a growing number of locations throughout the Bay Area. Philz does not make espresso, instead they make coffee one cup at a time from their 20+ custom blends. Blends whose exact mixes they keep secret, but which are each unique and quite tasty. This is a $3+ single cup of coffee which is worth every penny. They have free wifi and a small selection of baked goods, but the main attraction is the amazing and very unique coffee. Coffee which is quite unlike any cup I\xe2\x80\x99ve had anywhere else. Philz is a unique and welcome addition to the coffee culture in San Francisco and now the greater Bay Area.Haus Coffee is a very new addition to San Francisco, opening just weeks ago, Haus Coffee is located at 3082 24th St. A beautiful, if minimalist space which soon will have a fantastic back patio, Haus serves coffee from Ritual Roasters. They have free wifi, large tables and very bright and airy space, with a fireplace for cool San Francisco evenings. One of my new favorite spots.Velo Rouge Cafe is a small cafe just blocks from Golden Gate Park at 798 Arguello Boulevard. They serve coffee from Ritual Roasters expertly prepared along with a great menu featuring local foods. Tasty food, great drinks and a fun space with a small be welcome set of tables outdoors. One of my favorite cafes in the Richmond district of San Francisco and a frequent stop on long weekend walks.Hollow, by far the smallest cafe on my list, is a tiny space in the Inner Sunset at 1435 Irving St. In a space smaller than my first studio apartment, around 400 sq ft nestled between other retail shops,\xc2\xa0 coffee from Ritual Roasters compliments the small but carefully selected products for sale. They have two tables inside with seating for only a few people, but the coffee is fantastic, the shopping excellent and owners friendly. A small gem of a cafe & design shop. Later this summer they will add a table outside. I spent a wonderful afternoon on a recent weekend drinking coffee and chatting with the owner.Mojo Bicycle Cafe is a cafe in the front, a bike shop in the back, Mojo Bicycle Cafe at 639A Divisadero St is a cafe and bar, serving a small selection of food and coffee from De La Paz & Ritual Roasters. Great coffee, good drink selection and you can buy a bike or get your bike repaired while you hang out. A small but fun space with a devoted customer base.The Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is another fairly new addition to San Francisco, the Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is a small cafe which opened up earlier this year next door to Cafe Du Nord nightclub & the Swedish American hall event space. Located at 2168 Market St the cafe features coffee from Ritual Roasters and very tasty food. The sandwiches are particularly good and go well with the great coffee. The free wifi is nice, though the space is a bit small and tables slightly crowded together, I have worked here but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t ideal for long working sessions.Cafe Du Soleil is a French cafe at 200 Filmore, just a block off of Haight St, has good but not fantastic coffee which is more than made up for having great food and a very French atmosphere. This is an adult cafe where you can enjoy great food, wine and coffee along with the free wifi and large communal table. The baked goods are exceptional and the ambiance makes this one of my favorite places to work in San Francisco. The coffee is good, but not as serious as at most of the other places on this list.Samovar Tea Lounge to end this list a place that does not serve coffee at all. Samovar Tea Lounge has three locations in San Francisco (297 Page Street at Laguna, Yerba Buena Gardens at 730 Howard St above the Moscone Center, and 498 Sanchez St in the Castro). Samovar is a place for serious tea and great food. I love coffee but I also am a serious fan of Tea, Samovar has the best tea I have found in San Francisco, served with patience and food that compliments the teas exceptionally well. The Yerba Buena Gardens location is another of my favorite spots for downtown business meetings but also for first dates. It transitions well from a relaxed environment for long conversations and relaxation to a great place for a first date.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other great cafes in San Francisco, cafes with loyal fans, friendly staff, tasty food and beverages but these are the places I return to again and again, the spots I take out of town guests to, the places I plan my day around visiting.source: http://slowbrand.com/2009/06/10/...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 24, 'answer_user': 'Roderick Chow'}, {'answer': 'Both Grove Cafes stay open late and are a good place to work from.There is one on Mission/3rd open till 11 PM every day.

Simpson "Dream Team" of lawyers, got busted for DUI by the SFPD in the early 1980s. He challenged the arrest in what was at time (maybe still) the longest misdemeanor trial in California history. He beat the rap. He wrote a book about the experience with a similarly long title, "How To Protect Yourself Against Cops in California and Other Strange Places." I read the book when I was doing a lot of DUI enforcement. Most of his advice would not be especially valuable to the typical driver. He advises refusing all tests, which will make for a stronger defense case, but will cause you to lose your driver\'s license for at least a year. Bailey could probably afford to take a cab or pay a driver, but most of us aren\'t that flush. He could also bury the prosecution with expert witnesses and investigator testimony, which also most of us can\'t afford. His legal strategy was similar to O.J.\'s: if you don\'t care what it costs and are willing to throw every conceivable defense into the mix, you can probably beat almost any rap.

It happens fairly simply: a person either mistakenly believes that they are under the limit of 0.08 BAC and okay to drive; or, a person drives despite knowing that they are over the limit. Next, they come into contact with a police officer. This is typically either at a traffic stop or a DUI checkpoint. Then, they start providing information that is helpful to the police officer\'s effort to gather evidence. Such as:"I only had a couple of drinks...""I was just headed home from the club...""Those bottles of booze in the trunk are actually my mom\'s..."The police officer is already making notes of your allegedly red eyes, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, disheveled appearance and the offensive scent of alcohol on your breath. Next the police officer will ask you to take some field sobriety tests. Most people don\'t know they are optional and designed to make you look bad. The police officer will say that after observing you take the tests, he or she believes you are under the influence of alcohol. He may ask you to take a PAS test, (portable breathalyzer) which is also optional. Next, he will arrest you and take you to the police station. You will be advised that under California implied consent law, you must take a blood or breath test. You can refuse and force them to get a warrant. However, for most cases, it is probably best to take the breath test. Sometime the next day, you will be released. As soon as you have yourself together, you should contact an experienced DUI attorney. You only have ten days in which to contact the DMV. Otherwise, your license will be suspended. A California DUI lawyer can guide you through the process and right to have your case reduced or dismissed. If you can\'t afford an attorney, the court will appoint you a public defender.Embed QuoteThis answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.... (more)Loading...

{'qid': 186, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85What is it like to go to medical school at a non-university, as compared with a medical school at a university?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'I go to medical school at UCSF, which is a health-sciences university in San Francisco. It has no affiliated undergraduate campus, and its various hospitals, research facilities, and schools are peppered in four locations throughout our fine city, with one additional campus in Fresno, CA. How\'s that for a "non-university" campus?! I\'ve never attended a medical school with an affiliated undergraduate divison, and my undergraduate institution didn\'t have a medical school attached to it (UC Berkeley). However, here are the things that I probably missed out on and\xc2\xa0 the things that I appreciate about my school: Lack of Non-Science OpportunitiesThe biggest adjustment for me has been the lack of random liberal arts seminars/classes/groups that I used to take for granted as being part of any university. The diversity of extracurricular interests/organizations is very sparse here. For example, I played jazz in college with some student groups and was hoping to keep that up in medical school. My school obviously has no jazz department and no established jazz groups of any kind. I truly miss being at a university where I could hop to a business seminar or join the sailing club "just because." It would have helped in balancing my life a little more and in pursuing my interests outside of medicine. Another major issue is the difficulty in attaining a dual-degree - unless it\'s an MPH, you\'ll have to leave the university to pursue your MBA, MPP, MHA, etc. School Social Life The fragmentation of the university can make it hard to meet non-medical students here. Pharmacy, dental, physical therapy and nursing are located at the main campus, but the PhD\'s and other researchers are peppered throughout the city. Social events and mixers aren\'t well-attended. Sometimes you just want to meet (or date) people who aren\'t somehow working in hospitals, but that\'s hard to find on campus. Fortunately, my school is also in a bustling city so I still meet great new people, but with the amount of time medical students spend on campus, the social diversity is still an issue .\xc2\xa0 Additionally, school spirit and name recognition are low at health-sciences schools for obvious reasons. We have no football team, mascot or undergraduate university that makes us famous around the nation. Unless people work in health or are from the area, most folks have no idea what UCSF is. When I go abroad, there is zero chance anybody has ever heard of it. Personally, I don\'t really care. And UCSF does have its own school spirit, but it\'s mainly based on how much pride we have in what we do and not on rah-rah college reputations. Phenomenal Health Science Opportunities Although my school very predictably couldn\'t offer the social or interdisciplinary opportunities a place like Harvard Medical School could, UCSF\'s basic science, translational science, and clinical research opportunities are brilliant. Since the school can devote all of its resources and endowment to medical research, teaching, and healthcare, everything we do is cutting-edge and medical students are loved for just getting involved. Anybody can write a paper or do independent research or start a community health project. Not many universities except health-science-only universities have medical, nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, dental, AND basic science programs, so the work done here is incredibly thorough, inter-professional, and well-informed. If you have an interest in ANY healthcare topic you can think of, UCSF has someone here you can get involved with. It\'s a well-oiled healthcare machine.Great Clinical Experience\xc2\xa0 Again, all of UCSF\'s resources go into health students, and the education here is top-of-the-line. The medical school, as (I tend to assume) the de-facto flagship of the institution, gets a great deal of attention in this respect (and though I can\'t be certain, I would say more attention than medical schools at places with undergrads attached). My university\'s mission is health-care based, so our school administration spends all of their time devoted to improving our learning. Our curriculum is almost always at the forefront of progressive teaching. Our students can train at essentially any clinic or hospital within a 30 mile radius of San Francisco. And our third-year clerkships come in six different flavors, only one of which is the traditional rotation-based track at most schools. We have incredible patient experiences way before third-year starts, and the administration pays very close attention to each and every one of us. I\'ll add more points if they come to me. Although there are negatives, I am happy that I\'ve come to a health-sciences campus. The medical training is incredible, and that\'s what I came here for.Embed QuoteVia  James Pan.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 7, 'answer_user': 'Sofia Noori'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 25, 23, 55), 'tag': ['Medical School', 'University of California, San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Alex K.

SideCar is a bit more freewheeling, though they do check out their drivers and monitor their ratings closely.

My guess is that cabs being more tightly regulated on the airport proper are likely to grumble but not refuse at SFO.

It\'s best for the driver if you don\'t do this while waiting to get off the plane.

You can probably make it to the airport in time for a 6am flight, but you are cutting it close. American Airporter is another good alternative. Lorries Airport Shuttle is the local GO Brand and is another good option.SuperShuttle generally gets bad reviews because they cart you all over the entire city at times. If you pick a provider like Airport Express SF, which does not serve the Sunset or Richmond neighborhoods, or anything west of the Presidio, you are much less likely to be carted around the city on your way to the airport.

Thus someone with a medallion today only needs to drive a minimal number of shifts to continue to qualify and can rent the use out the rest of the time. So you can theoretically drive a few days a month and for the rest of the month expect to receive a few thousand dollars in exchange for "loaning" use of your medallion.

The cost of gas comes out of the drivers pocket. That means that when gas prices go up, you are being subsidized by the driver who takes a hit at the gas pump for carrying you around. Every once in a great while the city raises the rates to adjust for cost of living and then the drivers sort of marginally catch up (not really, since they don\'t make up what they lost in the past) and the public for a short time (until the oil companies decide there is a "shortage" again) are on a par closer to what the driver is experiencing.In my personal opinion, the cost of taxt fares (as well as Uber) should be closely tied to the cost of gas and fluctuate with it. Instead the drivers make a donation at the pump for their customers. This is one of the blatantly inequal facts of driving for a living. Everyone profits but the driver, who is in a constantly declining rate of return, only to be "adjusted" briefly, so the city can say how fair they are by adjusting the taxi rates. Medalions have little to do with this and adding more would not lower or raise the price, only the competition to the existing drivers.After responding I noticed that the fare increase was actually\xc2\xa0 eight months ago and the actual most recent rise in fuel has been in the last couple of months. My costs went from $40 or so a night to $65 or so a night, and recently due to a decline, back down to below $60. All the same, don\'t forget that the drivers are the ones who bear the brunt of most of the decisions long before the public. The public might complain for a time and everyone listens to them, cab drivers complain and everyone dismisses it as "just cab drivers whining". I can tell you they do actually have some foundation for what they say, regardless of whether they are lazy slobs who don\'t really want to work or those of us who work as hard as the buisness available will allow.Embed QuoteVia  Steve Davis.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Peter Ashlock'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 6, 16, 9, 7), 'tag': ['San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Taxis', 'San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Steve Davis'}

The general idea is that drivers and riders use mobile phones connected to a web service to arrange rides. The drivers, some professional, are paid in various ways.

Lyft and Sidcar are generally offering taxi prices while Uber is ten times as expensive and UberX (meant to compete with Lyft & Sidecar) three times for a ten-mile tip.\xc2\xa0Based on the (questionable) theory that one is willing to spend a fixed, very small percentage one one\xe2\x80\x99s net worth, the 30% of people in the US who have a net worth of $250,000 or more would pay $50. So maybe Uber\xe2\x80\x99s prices are not as outrageous as they appear. Some real market data would help here.\xc2\xa0The large price gap suggests that lower cost services might charge a bit more if the additional revenue could be used to make the quality of service predictably high. \xc2\xa0There is an opportunity for new services is to provide significantly better service than incumbents who have not upgraded service in fifty years. The new models have potential advantages:There seems to be no regulatory limit on the number of drivers, and GPS allows many more people to be effective navigators of cities. Currently, several services seem to be understaffed with drivers; and there is intense competition for them.When drivers supply their own cars, there is no capital investment needed by the service and the drivers might be better.Many sophisticated dispatching, traffic prediction, and demand management computer tricks can be tried, copying from the airlines.Detailed feedback on every transaction, on both rider and driver, might produce better service eventually.Current urban culture seems to reduce car ownership.Current employment conditions encourage part-time driving jobs for those who own cars.However, we are a little dubious about the potential for providing notably better service than today\xe2\x80\x99s taxis when the drivers are still independent contractors. The organizations with really great service\xe2\x80\x94Disney, Zappos, Marriott, etc.\xe2\x80\x94typically have permanent employees, extensive training, and a highly developed culture. An interesting test comparison of this issue can be found in UPS vs. Fedex. UPS\xe2\x80\x99s delivery people are permanent employees belonging to union. Fedex\xe2\x80\x99s are contractors. As a result Fedex\xe2\x80\x99s labor rates are roughly half of UPS\xe2\x80\x99s; but their service is inferior, especially for ground service. None of the companies seem to have plans to greatly exceed the service levels of existing services. Lyft and Sidecar offer taxi-quality service, and Uber offers limousine-quality service. There are some entirely independent drivers who have developed continuing relationships with customers by providing superb, personalized service. There may be an opportunity to become the Zappos of taxi service, but the method is not clear.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 44, 'answer_user': 'Jim Morris'}, {'answer': "So, I think that in order to answer this, the answer has to be broken down into two items: overall company (culture, people, experience) and technology.I'll start by noting that I've used both services and I like them a lot. However, Lyft has moved itself onto the homescreen of my iPhone for a number of reasons.Company: A lot of the next paragraph is likely subjective, but this is just how I'm calling it. I like the Lyft culture better. I've had more friendly drivers, I think the #lyftbump - though some say silly - is a fun and quirky tradition, much like the pink mustaches. It's these quirks that help bring together a stronger sense of culture that ultimately builds into a community.Those pink mustaches also make the process of identifying your driver as he/she approaches much easier when using Lyft. When using Sidecar, there's those awkward moments when I step toward a card that I think is my ride and then back off after realizing it's not. Technology: Some of the other answers make the point creating a profile and having to authenticate with Facebook. That's a very fair point, and I certainly understand why many people prefer to avoid Facebook authentication. However, in my mind, there is one functional step of the software that actually makes a huge difference in my experience. With Lyft, you don't have to state your end destination in the app when you request a ride. With Sidecar, as of the last time I used it, this is not the case - you have to state your end destination.This is a problem for Sidecar for two reasons. The first is that it means drivers can ignore my request if they don't like my destination request (for example, if I want to go somewhere way out like Dogpatch or Outer Sunset). The second reasons it hurts my experience is that it eliminates all use cases where I may be traveling with a friend who wants to get dropped off halfway. When I input my destination, the driver is given a route that they are supposed to take. Any deviations or stops not on this route are generally frowned upon and supposedly the drivers will get a call asking them where on earth they're taking the passenger? Anyway, this causes a lot of Sidecar drivers to not want to take any passenger that wants to make multiple stops. Lyft on the other hand, handles this just fine and drivers are happy to fulfill this sort of request.That's my two cents.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 25, 'answer_user': 'Zach Cole'}, {'answer': 'Another driver\'s perspective - I have signed up as a driver for both and have gone through the training for both services.\xc2\xa0 From my initial impression, Sidecar comes across as a grassroots, entrepreneurial effort, and Lyft comes across as a corporate driven tech company.\xc2\xa0 Lyft seems to have deeper pockets - they give bonuses for referrals, they staff all have the latest macbooks and fancy technology.\xc2\xa0 But they also require you to give you availability and give you shifts that you are required to work.

However, I tend to use Sidecar more frequently since it seems to be edging out Lyft in terms of availability. If I had to pick one, I\'d go with Sidecar since availability trumps everything else.Here\'s my view on Lyft versus Sidecar:Availability - As mentioned before, I use both services regularly but I find that Sidecar is more reliable during off-peak hours. I believe that the Sidecar has more drivers on the road during daytime hours as I have had trouble getting a Lyft during these times. In addition, Sidecar has been piloting a feature where you can book an occupied driver if their end point is near you. Lyft wouldn\'t be able to do this. Edge: SidecarPricing / Checkout - In terms of actual cost, both are fairly even. However, I like that Sidecar gives me a cost estimate before I enter the car so I\'m never surprised. There are cases where the avg. donation (on both Lyft & Sidecar) is actually more expensive than a cab ride in which case I\'d take a cab. Lyft doesn\'t let me price shop. In addition, it bothers me that Lyft automatically collects a "suggested donation" if you don\'t donate at the end. Edge: SidecarDrivers - There\'s been a lot of hype on the Lyft culture and brand. While I do appreciate the fist bump, I\'ve had fun (and not so fun) drivers on both services. Lyft, however, seems to have a slight edge in terms of fun rides. Edge: Lyft Brand Marketing - This is where Lyft is doing extremely well. I\'ve heard many people talk about the iconic pink mustaches. It\'s a nice way to market the service and build buzz; Sidecar doesn\'t really have much in terms of branding. Edge: Lyft Referrals - Sidecar has a $10 referral program that they actively (possibly aggressively) promote. It\'s what got me hooked on the service and my first two months of rides were paid purely off referrals bonuses. I don\'t know of any referral program for riders on Lyft. Edge: SidecarEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 18, 'answer_user': 'Saikat Bhadra'}, {'answer': 'I personally love being a Lyft driver (and passenger) because I get to have such a down-to-earth experience with every passenger in my car. The fist-bump is a subtle little "hello" instead of the standard handshake (which feels too formal and boring), and every passenger is welcome to change the music, charge their iPhones, change the temperature of the car, and chat with us on whatever subject they want - just like being in their best friend\'s car. The passenger-driver vibe is what makes the Lyft culture so unique and fun. Lyft drivers are happy to go above and beyond for their passengers - providing mints and gum, carrying groceries up three flights of stairs, or transforming the inside of the car to a fun photobooth on weekend nights - it\'s the little touches (and personalities) drivers bring to the experience that make it unique. Many drivers (including myself) have even found new friends among the passengers we drive.My two cents on a few things: Lyft culture: I\'ve worked at a few companies prior to Lyft, one of which was a startup. What I can say is that the team at Lyft is the most genuine you\'ll ever meet in terms of a startup company, however large or small. Lyft is run by Zimride, which has been around for over four years; they do have a very professional team, which is a good thing from my perspective. From my experience as a driver for Lyft, I\'ve always felt like part of the team and welcome at the HQ.\xc2\xa0 There is nothing yuppie or fake about the culture of Lyft/Zimride.For the drivers, Lyft organizes regular Driver Hangouts so that all drivers can get to know each other, swap stories, and offer tips on how to make the passenger experience even better. It\'s a fun way to keep the driver community familiar and friendly. Safety and support:The Lyft support team is always available via phone, email, or social media to help passengers and drivers if the need comes up. They take safety and customer support super seriously and have always been there when I\'ve needed them, even at crazy hours. Their system tracks driver and passenger info and locations all the time, which puts my mind at ease that I\'m covered if something weird happens.Insurance:As a driver, this is huge for me. Lyft recently got a $1 million excess liability insurance policy, which kicks in above drivers\' own auto insurance. Sidecar says they *will* have insurance, but it doesn\'t look like they have it yet.\xc2\xa0 I feel much better knowing there\'s backup coverage for me and my passengers if anything ever happens.Driver vetting: As I\'ve been with Lyft for a long while now, I\'ve seen the driver community grow tremendously. From what I can gather, the interview and training process at Lyft is very rigorous to ensure we have a great group of drivers. In turn, drivers are encouraged to recommend friends and family they know who would be great drivers, which helps keep the fun culture that all of our passengers have come to expect and enjoy. And just to clear one thing up - now that Lyft is launched out of beta, drivers are only compensated by passenger donations.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 63, 'answer_user': 'Nancy Tcheou'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 12, 5, 8, 52), 'tag': ['Uber, Lyft, Sidecar Comparisons', 'Zimride', 'San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Sidecar', 'Lyft', 'Ride-Sharing', 'Uber'], 'question_user': 'Jennifer Jones'}
{'qid': 232, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Following the January 9th UberX price cuts, how do UberX rates compare with Lyft and Sidecar in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': "Overall, UberX's fare changes price them significantly below their competitors during normal hours. Based on a quick sampling I've found that UberX fares are between 10-25% below that of Lyft & Sidecar. In particular, longer distance trips to East Bay look significantly cheaper. This is an interesting move because it's possible that Uber can price cut Lyft & Sidecar out of the market because Uber\xc2\xa0 has a very high margin business (black cars) that they can rely on cash flow along with >$300M in VC funding. It will be interesting to see how their competitors try to build a defensible moat outside of pricing.Some caveats:Surge Pricing - If UberX has surge pricing, then during these periods UberX will definitely not be competitive with Sidecar & Lyft. From what I recall, surge pricing multipliers start at the 1.5X range. Surge pricing regularly occurs during weekend evenings, so during this period Lyft & Sidecar will be cheaper by a long shot.UberX Fares - Fare estimates are based the in app calculator. All other fares listed below are actual fares.High Traffic Fares- Sidecar is the only competitor which locks in fares prior to the rate. Thus, I've found that Sidecar can be priced best during high traffic periods where your ride is in gridlock (i.e. office traffic). During these times, your Uber / Lyft fares will jack up as part of the formula is time, while Sidecar largely prices on distance.So to summarize, the cheapest player during: Normal hours - UberX High traffic - SidecarHigh demand - Lyft / SidecarSample SF FaresUnfortunately, you can't price shop with Lyft as they don't have a fare estimator so many of these routes lack a Lyft fare .

They take 20% of the action for their overheads, which does seem reasonable.No matter what you do, do not believe the 'nudge nudge, wink wink' treatment that your potential co-worker drivers at Lyft or Sidecar may say about this income not being taxable income - it absolutely is. Only when the costs are ridesharing costs ($0.565/mile or less) can they be viewed as non-commercial. We've heard that Lyft will issue you 1099's, which is the appropriate thing to do, so you can report this commercial income on your taxes.Anecdotal information gleaned from some Sidecar and Lyft drivers indicates that they earn between $600-$1,200 per week, depending on which shifts they choose to work.\xc2\xa0 That would work out to about $30/hour. That information was obtained in San Francisco, of course, where there is an undersupply of taxis and so, consequently, relatively high demand for these peer-to-peer taxi services.

By contrast, using Avego ridesharing, if you were simply to split the cost of the drive, this would cost $1.72 - ten times cheaper than a taxi, or 14 times cheaper than Sidecar in this case. I'm told Lyft is about the same price as a taxi, although again I've heard from a friend that on shorter rides Lyft could be perhaps $1 more than a taxi.In general, Avego has calculated in other cities, taxi services charge about 9 times the cost of ridesharing: a couple of dollars per mile on average versus the average of $0.25 that ride sharers pay (ridesharing is generally capped at the IRS reimbursement rate, which as of June 2013 is set at $0.565 per mile.There is a lot of feedback online from people about both Lyft and Sidecar.

So if you're driving a passenger across town, long runs to the airport, paying bridge toll, driving a passenger to Palo Alto, the passenger has the option of donating nothing to you as a community driver. Meeting new people, discovering new places in the city & being a friend giving a ride to another friend should be your motivation. Some passengers are cheap & donate $4.00 to driving from point A to B in 30 mins. So your time, gas & wear & tear on your vehicle is worth $4.00, or $8.00 an hour. After that, SideCar gets 20% of that $8.00. This is only when you pick up cheapskate passengers that never tip AND donate less than the suggested amt. That's just human nature. Driving for SideCar, Lyft or Uber X puts alot of miles on your vehicle. So you might make $400 this week & end up spending $1500 next month on car maintenance such as catalytic converter, new struts or brakes, etc. Another problem being a SideCar driver is some passenger cheat by entering a closer destination than the actual destination to get a lower suggested donation amt and request that you pick up two other friends at different location then drop them off at different different residence.\xc2\xa0 If you don't, you'll get a one star rating & terminated as a sidecar driver for having low rating. According to the SideCar fare calculator, the suggested donation for this ride is $6.40.

Fist bumps happen to be a big part of that culture. Since working at Lyft, I\'ve gotten used to fist bumps over handshakes. In fact, I don\'t think I remember the last time I gave a Lyfter a handshake instead of a first bump. Lyft drivers are encouraged to delight their passengers and make them feel comfortable. The fist bump, in my opinion, is a great way of initiating the ride experience because it starts an informal connection between passenger(s) and driver. To me, the fist bump sends the message of "Hey. We\'re in this ride together and it\'s going to be awesome". As a side note, fist bumps are more hygienic than handshakes(http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/...).Embed QuoteVia  Ryhan Hassan.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 11, 'answer_user': 'Chris Grant'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 2, 0, 5), 'tag': ['Lyft', 'Lyft Drivers & Driving for Lyft', 'San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Sidecar', 'Ride-Sharing', 'Taxis', 'Uber'], 'question_user': 'Ryhan Hassan'}

{'qid': 243, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Does the relationship between transportation and urban form resemble the dilemma of the chicken and the egg?', 'answers': [{'answer': "The two are deeply related, but I would argue for a different relationship than you imply.Urban form is very highly dependent on population density. In America, the real determinant of density is the age of a city. Any city built primarily before automobiles became popular (pre-1940) has a dense, walkable urban form and cities that were built after that generally do not. There are exceptions to this, but less than you would think. Portland, for example, despite being held up as an example of modern urban planning, is not very dense by the standards of San Francisco, New York, or even less well-known dense older cities such as Baltimore and Buffalo.Density does tend to determine typical modes of transportation in a place, as public transit is not efficient when a place is very spread out. Low-density places are necessarily car-dependent, whereas high-density places tend to be more transit-oriented because the systems don't need to be as heavily subsidized, so the government can afford to run them. If a place is car-dependent, you need space for a lot of parking, which generally occupies 1-2x as much square footage as the building itself, effectively making good urban form impossible, since no one walks through seas of parking by choice.Once public transit is in place, then people walk more, since they have to walk from the bus or subway stop to their work and might stop at a pastry shop on the way. People walking creates good urban form, with businesses built up to the street providing a wide diversity of services.So, I would argue that it is not a chicken-and-egg scenario, exactly.Rather, both are dependent on density, and the relationship goes: Density creates transit creates walkable urbanism.Pseudo-examples of this do exist in places like Denver and Portland that are more car-dependent, but those are small areas of urbanism with parking lots a few blocks away. For true, widespread, good urbanism, I would argue that the relationship above is the only way to create it.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'LaLuce Mitchell'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 2, 17, 0, 12), 'tag': ['London Taxis', 'San Francisco Taxi Services', 'Metropolitan Transit Authority', 'New Urbanism', 'Subways', 'Public Transport', 'New York City Subway (MTA)', 'Taxis', 'Urban Planning', 'Transportation', 'Cycling', 'Civil Engineering'], 'question_user': 'Matthew Hartzell'}

Also heard Brian Schottenheimer and Marty Mornhinweg. Mike Holmgren's name gets tossed around for this, but it just seems like too much of a dream.My guess: 49ers hire a strong GM and Jon Gruden.

{'qid': 259, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': "\xc3\xa2\xc2\x98\xc2\x85What is the best thing to do about the San Francisco Giants' woeful defense this season?", 'answers': [{'answer': "Some thoughts...Catcher - We should find a way to bring Chris Stewart back from the Yankees! He's a terrible hitter but an outstanding defensive catcher, and a much better Posey stand-in than Hector Sanchez. I say they find a new defensive backup catcher (not sure if any of the current guys qualify) and either trade Sanchez or let him develop in the minors. The Giants won't do this because they have such a weak bench they need a backup catcher who can hit a bit. They also want an heir apparent for Posey, who will eventually find himself at 1st or 3rd.First Base - Belt is an outstanding defensive first baseman and he has a lot of years to get better before age becomes an issue. Second Base - Scutaro is an exceptional contact hitter but his age is showing at second. Personally, my favorite part of a Giants game is watching Scutaro hit, so I say play him as often as possible and live with the defense. With that said, a late inning replacement would be a good idea, and while Arias can do it he's more valuable at SS and more needed at 3rd. However, since the Giants are so weak on the bench, they can't afford to keep a weak-hitting replacement on the roster to cover second (such as Noonan or one of these other young guys). Shortstop - Crawford is somewhere between good and great defensively and between mediocre and good at the plate, certainly good enough that the Giants are committed to keeping him at SS for the foreseeable future. Third Base - Pablo just need to commit to being a major league baseball player and keep himself fit. If that happens, he may be more than sufficient at 3rd base. If not, or if fitness isn't the only issue, this is a position that could use an upgrade on offense and defense. Posey may be the solution, but that whole situation could go a lot of ways.Outfield - Whether it's Blanco or Perez, the giants have an option for a base-stealing backup outfielder who can shine defensively when needed. Pence and Pagan are solid defenders and they're not going anywhere. Left field is the obvious deficiency, but honestly, offense is going to be the factor here, not defense. Nonetheless, I don't think anyone criticizes the Giants outfield defense when it's Pence, Pagan, Blanco, but I'd bet on defense weakening when they find a new everyday left fielder. I'm not sure when this question was posted, but defense seems to have stabilized for the Giants this season. Not great, but not terrible. And although the offense has been rightly criticized, we need to remember that it's basically these same team that just won the World Series. The real problem is pitching, primarily starting pitching, and I hope to see that addressed before offense or defense. I don't think it's a coincidence that the hitting declined in tandem with the pitching - hitting was actually among the best in the majors for the first month or so of the season. Then the pitching really suffered, and offense followed.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 0, 'answer_user': 'Anonymous User'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 8, 8, 45), 'tag': ['San Francisco Giants', 'Sports in San Francisco', 'MLB', 'Baseball'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

With live entertainment a food retailer can stay open until 2am, but they're hard to get, and cost so much you might as well get a permit to sell alcohol as well.There are a few special use districts, like the food truck ghetto across from Costco, where a mobile fast food retailer can stay open until 2.

I've also spent cumulative months in New York City and London, the former having plenty of late-night options, the latter not. My theory is that late-night places need a relatively wide geographic/population coverage area funneling in to be sustainable.In Dallas and Austin, most people have cars and can drive to places like Kerbey Lane, the 24 Diner, or Epoch Coffee at any hour from nearly anywhere in the metropolitan area. So, even a relatively low density of night owls is enough, when concentrated via transport, to sustain a decent number of businesses.In New York City, people don't generally have cars, but there's substantial public transportation (even subways) at all hours. Such transit is possible partly because the subway lines have many bypasses allowing concurrent transport service and maintenance. London and SF have to shut down their rail transit nightly for maintenance.In San Francisco and London, cars are also rare, but there are only skeleton transit services past 11 or 12pm at night. The food and coffee options in either place are pretty bad past 10 or 11pm. The ones that do exist either have parking (The Lucky Penny and the IHOP on Lombard) or are in night life/tourist areas (Sparky's and Pinecrest).I'm wondering if there are good counter-examples: metro areas over 1M people with (1) poor late-night transit options and good late-night coffee/dining or (2) solid late-night transit options (in the form of public transit or car-centrality) and bad late-night options.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 10, 'answer_user': 'David Strauss'}, {'answer': "I think the real reason is the high minimum wage.

Kopi-Tarik may work better because you have a large segment of gourmet coffee drinkers already. You don't have the same for tea. The recipe will also be important. There has to be something different that can justify the cost. My thought is spiced tea - cinnamon or nutmeg or a mixture of spices passed down the generations from the first time..... That gives a good backstory. The fundemental problem, as I see it, is that Teh-Tarik isn't that special. I've had something similar in the a British army, in Kenya, in India and in Ethiopia.

The Summit - The newest addition to the scene, this place is basically built for startups. There are good working areas as well as more social areas. The best way to become popular here is to bring a 3-outlet adapter.Ritual Coffee Roasters - A traditional hotspot for caffeine & code.Haus - While this place attracts some startup people, it\'s not a great place for a conversation. Better for putting your headphones on, cranking your preferred SomaFM station, and getting things done.Honorable mention: Stable, Atlas, Philz, Sugarlump, Morning Due Cafe...SF - SOMA:Epicenter Cafe - Absolutely teeming with startups. It\'s ridiculous. Also at the cutting edge of sustainability (they won a Carrotmob!).Blue Bottle Coffee - There are shockingly few good independent coffee shops right near downtown. The Blue Bottle at Mint Plaza ends up attracting a whole lot of movers and shakers. Unfortunately, there\'s not a lot of room to sit and work, nor can you really have a meal. Best for quick meetings.Caffe Centro - Right in the middle of South Park, great for meetings or lunch. Definitely a startup hub.Crossroads Cafe - A bit off the beaten path (unless you are working at Dogpatch Labs), but a great spot. As far as startup-oriented patrons, this place has quality, not quantity. This is where I first met my co-founder at my first company.Honorable mention: Brainwash, The Grove, Samovar...Palo Alto:Coupa Cafe - Everyone here is doing a startup. Good luck getting a table.Philz - I mean, it\'s hardly worth listing them... all coffee shops in Palo Alto fall into the "startup hotspot" category.University Cafe - Best for meetings and pitches, not so much for laptops.The CoHo - It\'s easy to forget, but the Coffee House on Stanford\'s campus is where you will find the best startup founders a couple years before anyone else finds them.Mountain View:Red Rock - Last time I was there, a remote-controlled robot came in and placed an order. Enough said.Dana Street Roasting Co - Again, you can\'t really go wrong in Mountain View.Oakland:Remedy - This new spot in Temescal feels particularly like a startup-magnet. Mainly in the sense that it seems like it was just magically transported over from the Mission.Berkeley:Free Speech Movement Cafe - In Berkeley, many of the startups are born at the University, so this expansive cafe right in the middle of the campus is a good spot to try.Brewed Awakening - Mostly grad students, but some of them are doing startups.People\'s Coffee and Tea - More undergrads here, and it\'s too quiet to talk non-awkwardly, BUT they\'re open til midnight.Local 123 - This is the best place to get away from the students but still find some startup people. Try the "salty goat" sandwich.That\'s my rundown. This list has been biased towards places which are hip and have a good vibe for working. I also left out Starbucks, Peets, and other big chains (not hip). There are lots of other places which probably contain a lot of startup people, but aren\'t quite as hip (like Maxfield\'s or Muddy Waters in the Mission). There are other places which have lots of startup people, but aren\'t good for working (like Four Barrel Coffee, which doesn\'t offer wifi or outlets, or Buck\'s of Woodside, which is a straight-up restaurant).

{'qid': 289, 'ans_num': 2, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why is Philz coffee different from other hand-poured coffee establishments in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'Multiple reasons. Let me first start by providing context.People sometimes categorize the coffee industry into waves, for example:1st wave = Folgers, Yuban, etc.. 2nd wave = Starbucks, Peet\xe2\x80\x99s, etc...3rd wave = Stumptown, Blue Bottle, etcThe 3rd wave is viewed as a step above the 2nd wave. It\'s artisanal, extra special and high quality. Mostly local coffee companies occupy this category - some small and medium-sized but none very large. 3rd wavers are rising in popularity in America\'s most progressive cities. \xc2\xa0While some may categorize Philz in the 3rd wave, we are different: \xc2\xb7 Vision: Our vision is to reinvent the coffee experience.\xc2\xa0 A cup of Philz is special. You start by ordering with a friendly Barista that helps you choose a blend they think you\'ll like best, craft it for you on the spot, and add anything you want in it to taste (milk, sugar, etc. or black, as many do). You don\'t leave our stores until you are 100% satisfied, but we do pretty well at blowing people\'s socks off after the first sip - our desired outcome :). When people wake up in the morning, I want them to say, "Let\'s go grab a Philz." Instead of \xe2\x80\x9cLets go grab a latte.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xb7 Secret recipe blends: Our secret recipe blends with charming names capture the essence of my dad\'s experience after his first sip. These blends were created by my dad (Phil) over decades, and are made of high quality varietals from around the world.\xc2\xa0 My favorite is the Tesora, a medium roast and our most popular blend.\xc2\xa0 We also offer a few varietals (single origin beans) at most of our stores, which are also really good.\xc2\xb7 Coffee personalized to taste: We believe that the best coffee in the world is the coffee that comes to each person\'s individual taste. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s different and what may taste great to one person may not be good to another.\xc2\xa0 At Philz, there is really something for everyone and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have such a diverse group of awesome customers who visit our stores. \xc2\xb7 Pioneers of the Coffee Bar: When you walk into a Philz, it\xe2\x80\x99s more like a bar than an actual coffee shop with Baristas who act as bartenders. At most artisanal coffee companies, customers pay first for a drink but at Philz, we\'ve reversed the process: order with your Barista, then pay. The reason for this is because we want our customers to interact directly with the Barista making their coffee. \xc2\xb7 Specialization: To focus on being exceptional at personalized, handcrafted coffee we don\'t serve espresso at our stores. When my dad, Phil, first shared the idea of Philz, his friends\' response was along the lines of: "You\'re an idiot.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no way you\'re going to succeed without lattes. You need to have espresso." Thank goodness we didn\'t listen.\xc2\xa0 Every month we convert thousands of latte/espresso drinkers into Philz Phanatics. \xc2\xb7 Local Relevance: Each Philz fits in community it lives in. The real design and build-out of a store begins on day one of opening - the team and community complete the design of each store and it\xe2\x80\x99s never ending. Our people have autonomy. We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s locally relevant.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xb7 Passionate people: The most important people at Philz are the people behind the counter.\xc2\xa0 They are everything.\xc2\xa0 Just like their mission is to better their customers\' days with an amazing coffee experience, our focus as senior leadership is to better their day so they leave their shift saying, "I love working at Philz." (BTW if anyone is interested in joining the Philz team and changing the coffee world, visit us here to learn more. Excuse our career site as it\'s under construction). I don\'t believe we are in the coffee business.\xc2\xa0 I believe we are in the people\'s business serving coffee.\xc2\xa0 After all, coffee is fun.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t take it too seriously.\xc2\xa0 It\'s habitual and part of so many people\'s days.\xc2\xa0 We are fortunate to have the opportunity to touch everyone\'s day with the best damn coffee we can. One day, I want to have 1000 stores, but the way I look at it is having one store 1000 times which means scaling mindfully; preserving the core values we work so hard to uphold every day. \xc2\xa0To really understand what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, I highly recommend you come by and give Philz a try. Let the Barista know if it\xe2\x80\x99s your first time and they will take care of you. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear feedback on peoples experiences.Embed QuoteVia  Miguel Paraz.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 189, 'answer_user': 'Jacob Jaber'}, {'answer': "Philz has a larger variety of coffees on their menu including many flavored coffees, and they'll add sweetener and cream to your coffee on request.

His article, in full:San Francisco Coffee is among the best in the world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am a serious coffee drinker, I started drinking coffee seriously in high school, spent many hours in college in cafes throughout Hyde Park. However in College my focus was cheap, free refills, and a good working environment, I was less concerned that the coffee was really high quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I was always passionate about local, independent cafes and while I lived in Chicago I grew to know and love many great small local cafes, spending most of my time in the ones that had great atmospheres and great coffee. Including among these was the amazingly high quality\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Inteligentsia Coffee which I was a customer of from their first cafe which opened up in Boystown and then later their locations downtown in the Loop. In the years since they have expanded to a cafe in LA and are among the growing Third Wave of cafes and local coffee roasters which have spread the serious coffee movement throughout the US and indeed around the globe.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have now lived in the Bay Area for 3 1/2 years, in this time I have seen an explosion of great coffee roasters and cafes, led by a group of local coffee roasters and a growing and large coffee culture here in San Francisco. In this post I will write up some of my current favorite cafes in San Francisco, from time to time I will update this post as new places open or old places close.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a frequent cafe customer I look for a few things in cafes I frequent on a regular basis.Great coffee. This should perhaps go without saying, but it makes a huge difference. There are some cafes whose space & location I love, but which I rarely frequent because the coffee does not match the space.Big tables. I have a theory of cafes. Small tables (think the tiny bistro tables of the traditional French cafe) make it hard to share a table with a stranger and make working on laptops awkward. My favorite cafes have always been the ones with large, oversized tables that promote sharing tables with strangers and allow for easy working with laptops.Free Wifi & Power. Though here I am will to make exceptions. Serious coffee trumps wifi \xe2\x80\x93 I just use my time in those cafes in different ways \xe2\x80\x93 for conversations, for time to catch up on my reading, for time to write offline. Later this year I expect I will have a portable data card (or tether my iPhone 3GS) so wifi will be less of an issue. Power too is easy to work around and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the worst thing to get up and move after 4+ hours in front of my laptop.Happy employees. The best cafes have happy, passionate employees. Employess who are treated well, who do their work with attention to detail and passion for quality.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other factors I look for in great cafes. Good food is always welcome especially if locally sourced. And being open late fits my lifestyle well. Thankfully in San Francisco I have many options.My not so short list of great cafes in San Francisco:Blue Bottle The coffee of choice for most of the top chefs in the Bay Area. Blue Bottle is one the best coffee roasters I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever tasted and their cafes are among the finest I know of anywhere in the world. It all started with their Kiosk in Hayes Valley at 315 Linden St and at the Ferry Building Farmer\xe2\x80\x99s Markets. Now they have an amazing new space at 66 Mint St, a full cafe inside of the Ferry Building and a new location in the rooftop garden of the SF MOMA. At their full cafe on Mint in addition to great coffee prepared with serious attention to detail and more methods of preparation than any other cafe I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, they also have a small but great selection of food options which change during the course of the day. No wifi, but one of my favorite spots for business meetings, especially around conferences at the nearby Moscone Center.Ritual Coffee Roasters. Ritual is rapidly overflowing their storefront location at 1026 Valencia St in the Mission where they removed couches and many tables to make room for their roaster and coffee storage in the back. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have any power outlets, but still manage to almost always have full tables and a line for their fantastic coffee. With only a small selection of food (albiet tasty baked goods) Ritual is a destination for coffee drinking and a spot where many people sit and work. I\xe2\x80\x99m the Foursquare mayor of Ritual on Valencia as a result of my many times a week visits. Ritual also has a smaller cafe inside of Flora Grub Gardens in Bayview at 1634 Jerrold Ave and a new cafe inside of the Oxbow Public Market at 610 First St in Napa. Ritual coffees are served by many great restaurants and cafes as well.Four Barrel Coffee Before they opened their well designed space at 375 Valencia St which features a large onsite coffee roaster and furniture built from reclaimed lumber, Four Barrel served coffee from the rear of their space via a kiosk open to the small alleyway. Founded by serious coffee people, Four Barrel is an example of a cafe that is all about the coffee, they have only a few baked goods and do not have wifi, yet are usually full until closing. They have a few wholesale customers here in SF and are a fantastic addition to the local coffee scene.Epicenter Cafe Another new addition to San Francisco, Epicenter Cafe is located at 764 Harrison. They are not a coffee roaster but take coffee and food very seriously. Their beans are from Barefoot Coffee Roasters in Santa Clara (who also provide coffee to Google \xe2\x80\x93 a company that takes food and drink fairly seriously). The coffee here is fantastic, what I love about the cafe is the space, high quality food, lots of tables, power outlets and free wifi. It is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in SOMA to work and have meetings.Coffee Bar \xe2\x80\x93 Probably my favorite overall cafe in San FranciscoCoffee Bar is located at the corner of Mariposa & Florida in Potrero Hill. The coffee here is from Mr Espresso in Oakland (one of the owners is part of the family that runs Mr Espresso) and is prepared with great attention to detail both as espresso shots or on their reasonably priced Clover machines. But it is the space and food which is why I so love Coffee Bar. They have a great menu of food and drinks including wine and beer and a multi-leveled space which has been designed with great attention to detail. They have a long bar with underbar power outlets perfect for working alone as well as many oversized tables perfect for groups or for sharing with others. On Thursdays and Fridays they turn the kitchen over to Radio Africa Kitchen which offers some of the best food in San Francisco at extremely reasonable prices. I find the location, food, and ambiance combine to make Coffee Bar one of my favorite cafes and a highly productive space either for working on my laptop or for having great business meetings.Philz coffee is a family run establishment here in San Francisco which has been expanding rapidly in the last few years, going from just a few locations when I first moved here to a growing number of locations throughout the Bay Area. Philz does not make espresso, instead they make coffee one cup at a time from their 20+ custom blends. Blends whose exact mixes they keep secret, but which are each unique and quite tasty. This is a $3+ single cup of coffee which is worth every penny. They have free wifi and a small selection of baked goods, but the main attraction is the amazing and very unique coffee. Coffee which is quite unlike any cup I\xe2\x80\x99ve had anywhere else. Philz is a unique and welcome addition to the coffee culture in San Francisco and now the greater Bay Area.Haus Coffee is a very new addition to San Francisco, opening just weeks ago, Haus Coffee is located at 3082 24th St. A beautiful, if minimalist space which soon will have a fantastic back patio, Haus serves coffee from Ritual Roasters. They have free wifi, large tables and very bright and airy space, with a fireplace for cool San Francisco evenings. One of my new favorite spots.Velo Rouge Cafe is a small cafe just blocks from Golden Gate Park at 798 Arguello Boulevard. They serve coffee from Ritual Roasters expertly prepared along with a great menu featuring local foods. Tasty food, great drinks and a fun space with a small be welcome set of tables outdoors. One of my favorite cafes in the Richmond district of San Francisco and a frequent stop on long weekend walks.Hollow, by far the smallest cafe on my list, is a tiny space in the Inner Sunset at 1435 Irving St. In a space smaller than my first studio apartment, around 400 sq ft nestled between other retail shops,\xc2\xa0 coffee from Ritual Roasters compliments the small but carefully selected products for sale. They have two tables inside with seating for only a few people, but the coffee is fantastic, the shopping excellent and owners friendly. A small gem of a cafe & design shop. Later this summer they will add a table outside. I spent a wonderful afternoon on a recent weekend drinking coffee and chatting with the owner.Mojo Bicycle Cafe is a cafe in the front, a bike shop in the back, Mojo Bicycle Cafe at 639A Divisadero St is a cafe and bar, serving a small selection of food and coffee from De La Paz & Ritual Roasters. Great coffee, good drink selection and you can buy a bike or get your bike repaired while you hang out. A small but fun space with a devoted customer base.The Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is another fairly new addition to San Francisco, the Cafe at Cafe Du Nord is a small cafe which opened up earlier this year next door to Cafe Du Nord nightclub & the Swedish American hall event space. Located at 2168 Market St the cafe features coffee from Ritual Roasters and very tasty food. The sandwiches are particularly good and go well with the great coffee. The free wifi is nice, though the space is a bit small and tables slightly crowded together, I have worked here but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t ideal for long working sessions.Cafe Du Soleil is a French cafe at 200 Filmore, just a block off of Haight St, has good but not fantastic coffee which is more than made up for having great food and a very French atmosphere. This is an adult cafe where you can enjoy great food, wine and coffee along with the free wifi and large communal table. The baked goods are exceptional and the ambiance makes this one of my favorite places to work in San Francisco. The coffee is good, but not as serious as at most of the other places on this list.Samovar Tea Lounge to end this list a place that does not serve coffee at all. Samovar Tea Lounge has three locations in San Francisco (297 Page Street at Laguna, Yerba Buena Gardens at 730 Howard St above the Moscone Center, and 498 Sanchez St in the Castro). Samovar is a place for serious tea and great food. I love coffee but I also am a serious fan of Tea, Samovar has the best tea I have found in San Francisco, served with patience and food that compliments the teas exceptionally well. The Yerba Buena Gardens location is another of my favorite spots for downtown business meetings but also for first dates. It transitions well from a relaxed environment for long conversations and relaxation to a great place for a first date.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many other great cafes in San Francisco, cafes with loyal fans, friendly staff, tasty food and beverages but these are the places I return to again and again, the spots I take out of town guests to, the places I plan my day around visiting.source: http://slowbrand.com/2009/06/10/...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 24, 'answer_user': 'Roderick Chow'}, {'answer': 'Both Grove Cafes stay open late and are a good place to work from.There is one on Mission/3rd open till 11 PM every day.

{'qid': 295, 'ans_num': 6, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85When did drip coffee become such a sensation in San Francisco, and why?', 'answers': [{'answer': "(Note: By drip coffee, I'm going to assume you mean the single-cup pour-over, which has become the standard preparation for brewed coffee in many of SF's independent coffeehouses.)The pour-over brewing method favored by Blue Bottle et al. originated in Japan, which is why many of the accouterments you see for sale in San Francisco's coffeehouses bear the brands Hario or Kyocera. In the late 2000s, shops like Blue Bottle began to import brewing methods and equipment from Japan, which lead to a proliferation of pour-over coffee throughout San Francisco (and LA, and Chicago, and Portland, etc.).One adopter \xe2\x80\x94 and importer \xe2\x80\x94 of Japanese gear was James Freeman of Blue Bottle Coffee in Oakland, San Francisco and now Brooklyn.... By 2009, pouring kettles and other gear were stocked by Blue Bottle Coffee and other independent shops like Ritual Coffee Roasters in San Francisco, Intelligentsia in Chicago and Los Angeles and Barismo in Arlington, Mass.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Pour-Over Coffee Wins Converts, NYTHowever, the reason pour-over coffee tastes unfamiliar and unpleasant probably has little to do with the brewing method. As pour-over brewing has become more popular in SF coffeehouses, so has light-roast single-origin coffee. Most familiar supermarket and Starbucks coffees are French- or Italian- style roasts. This means the internal temperature of the coffee bean reaches 240-245 C during roasting, which produces a dark-brown, shiny, low-acidity bean and diminishes much of the origin character of the coffee. Regardless of the beans you start with, the predominant flavors in most dark-roast coffee will be similar. By contrast, independent SF roasters generally roast their beans to an internal temperature of 196 - 210 C, producing a caramel-colored, low-oil, acidic coffee bean which retains many of the characteristic origin flavors of the coffee when brewed. (see Coffee roasting)If you are used to drinking with home-brewed Folgers coffee, or black coffee from Dunkin Donuts, or Italian style espresso beverages, or Viennese coffee, or even pour-over brewed French roast, the light-roast, pour-over drip coffee at Blue Bottle or Ritual is likely to taste foreign, and possibly unpleasant. [Philz is a totally different story (which I won't even address here), and the beverages they serve are practically a different product category than what is served at every other coffee shop I've visited.]Ultimately with matters of food and drink, De gustibus non est disputandum. Just because something is popular, or elite, or well-received by critics doesn't mean that everyone will or needs to enjoy it. The best cup of coffee I've ever had was a latt\xc3\xa9 from a drive through Starbucks on my way home from a 5-day backpacking trip.Pour-over brewing is fundamentally the same method that the ubiquitous $15 Mr. Coffee counter top drip coffee machine employs. Hot water is slowly dripped through a paper cone containing ground coffee. Gravity pulls the water through the grounds, and coffee filters out the bottom of the cone into a vessel such as a cup or carafe. However, the Mr. Coffee has several critical flaws, which pour-over brewing addresses: Brew Temperature: The water that comes out of many electric drippers and into the brew basket is outside the optimal 92-96 C range. Specifically it's too cold - often closer to 70 C. Volume: Most electric dripper brew baskets are too small to accommodate the ideal volume of coffee grounds (~ 55g coffee / 1L of water), especially given the swelling that occurs when the grounds are moistened during brewing. Holding Temperature: Most counter top electric dippers are designed with a glass carafe that sits on top of a hot plate. This essentially burns the coffee after brewing it, by heating it above the recommended holding temperature range of 80-85 C. \xc2\xa0 per Specialty Coffee Association of AmericaEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 37, 'answer_user': 'Peter Rigano'}, {'answer': "Drip coffee is the signature beverage of weak-willed and lily-livered drips, who have taken over a once wild and great city with their incessant gazing and pecking at their palms and fleet of identical candy-coated bi-cycles:The city of San Francisco, the two times it has really mattered to the world, was built by thugs and ruffians and freaks. The first time, it was the sharp-elbowed 49ers who came from nowhere, with nothing, determined to dynamite and hack fortunes out of the ground, along with the whores and gamblers and distillers and opium purveyors who serviced them. They made their damn coffee by throwing a pound of beans into an enamel pot of crick water sitting square in a fire and gargling down the fierce mud that boiled up.The second time, San Francisco got lit by faggots and dykes and the otherwise sexually vibrant and alive and unashamed, along with drug fiends and revolutionaries, all of whom banged up against Irish cops and Italian mobsters and hard-working schoolteachers. They made their coffee by mainlining espresso and having group sex all night before forgetting to ever get a job in the first place and hanging out naked in the sunshine at Golden Gate Park all day.Now San Francisco has been colonized by ironic, precious brunch-goers crawling all over one another to pay $4,000 for a one bedroom apartment where they code 19 hours a day and take Viagra at 25. I'm not surprised that jubilant bohemian celebrator-of-life Kyle Pennell found reasons to absquatulate!

Indeed the lack of the drip in Europe is why there is a Cafe Americana in the first place. You will find one of these in pretty much every coffee drinking home in the United States, this is not a new phenomenon. A pretty large subset of people have these at home because it is ideal for one person. My girlfriend has one, I have the pot above (no really its the exact same white pot, Mr. Coffee is a pretty big deal)What you maybe referring to are coffee housing that use the second option to produce their drip coffee on an individual basis instead of using one of these:It works on the same premise as the other two, just designed to serve more people. These pour over drip houses that have done away with these costly bad boys look something like this:Its all the same basic technology. Like all variations though it requires picking good beans and having the correct grind for the process used. Its different, not better or worse. Espresso is its own thing, if you like that get espresso; there are plenty of good places to get it pretty much anywhere. The great things about living here is you have lots of choice.I think pour over houses have begun to crop up because you have less overhead. Big drip units and espresso machines are very costly up front. This increases the turnaround to profit or makes failure less costly.Another reason I believe this type of production has come to be is the influence of Pho on America. It is common to see coffee produced like so in a Pho establishment:Its drip coffee that is AMAZING and Pho is very popular with folks under 35.So You have:A long history of drip coffee production in the U.S.Pour-over Drip being popularized with younger audiences via PhoYoung entrepreneurs that want to start business but are skiddish about loans in our current economic environment looking for a low barrier to be their own bossIts a perfect storm really.

For my taste, they have the best espresso in the city, rich and creamy and not the slightly-astringent flavor that seems to be so popular these days.

Go early, lines get ridiculous after 8am on Saturday (farmer\'s market day at the FTB). Very little seating, so take your coffee and go sit on benches outside and watch the ferries and shoppers. Excellent lattes and cappuccinos, they use whole Clover organic milk by default. And yes, the waffles are amazing. MUNI/BART accessible (Embarcadero)Sightglass Coffee by Civic Center. Trendy. Good espresso and coffee. Cool decor. I imagine it gets very busy, but early morning on a Saturday the people-watching was mostly hospital staff and a couple of other parents.

Due to the lack of demand, there aren't as many high-end stores or large shopping centers here as people would expect. So if a woman did want to change her look, she would have to consciously make an effort to do it. It seems a lot of people on this post don't really like how women from SF look or present themselves, but also remember that a plus side (from my experience) is that many of us SF women are NOT as materialistic and more accepting of different ideas than many women in LA. For example, someone like me is more open to the idea of accepting a nerdy, artistic, flamboyant, talkative, quiet, unique, or alternative guy than a woman from LA would be and just about every woman I know from this area is the same. Considering the fact that LA is home to Hollywood, every time I visit it, I expect that people want to be glamorous and focus on their looks more.

There are many differences between people in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I believe it is due to the differences in the cities. This reply contains gross generalizations but I believe them to be roughly true and I believe they affect how people (and women) live their lives in each city. Many of these generalizations are about people between 20 and 35 as I spend the most time with them. Full disclosure: I was raised in a wealthier community in Los Angeles and as a result my position on the matter may be skewed.Many jobs in Los Angeles are in entertainment. My friends are actors, PAs, editors, camera men, riggers, and musicians. Their parents are directors, producers, actors, musicians, record execs, etc. Even people in tech in Los Angeles are involved in entertainment - they create video editing software, they run digital post productions houses, etc. They are less stressed out and more laid back than San Franciscans as their jobs often don't allow them to work a single 60-80 hour a week desk job. Many people in LA (and the entertainment business) get where they are through networking, persistence, luck, and working their way up the chain. LA is also far more ethnically diverse residents. There are significant Jewish, Korean, Chinese, Persian, Mexican, and other populations within LA. Neighborhoods also contain many children/grandparents/families in Los Angeles. LA is also far more affordable to live in and has a huge range housing costs and there is often more class diversity. People in LA are often judged by what they look like, who they are, what kind of car they drive, and who they know.Most of the women I know in the bay area are developers, project managers, salespeople, account managers, recruiters, and the like. They work in finance, technology, and creative spaces. They are often extremely ambitious and career oriented and many of them get where they are through 60 hour work weeks behind a desk. SF seems much less culturally, politically, and financially diverse than LA. That said, one can find many diverse ethnic populations by leaving SF proper and heading to Oakland, Daly City, San Jose, Milpitas, and many other nearby neighborhoods. SF has a higher cost of living than LA which seems to result in more homogenous middle-to-upper class citizens. San Francisco has far fewer K-12 students and senior citizens. San Franciscans are typically more tech oriented in general. People in SF are often judged by their careers and business successes.I find women in San Francisco to be more into technology, more progressive, more interested in politics, less religious, and more ambitious.I find women in Los Angeles to be more diverse politically, more into fashion and style, more on top of television and the latest cultural trends, more laid back, and have much larger diversity in their career choices and incomes.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 37, 'answer_user': 'Michael Margolis'}, {'answer': "I lived in LA (West Hollywood/Beverly Hills) for 7+ years working in fashion and entertainment PR before moving up to SF a few months ago.

When I was interviewing for jobs in SF, I was told by a resident friend that dressing like that would make me look out of place and weird. (He was right -- the office was full of jeans and sneakers!) The SF-y laid-back attitude definitely translates into the way women up here dress. For example, I had never seen a woman in a pair of TOMS shoes until moving to SF -- practically every woman up here owns a pair! But I have yet to see a woman in Louboutins or even carrying a Louis Vuitton handbag (which is the unofficial uniform down in LA, I swear).

The problem up here is as much total failure to know good style as much as it is the lack of effort. Basically, nearly everyone in LA looks better then nearly everyone in SF - even in jeans and t-shirts. That is not why I prefer the LA Ladies tho - it's that SF women are among the most dogmatic and judgmental self selected population I've ever encountered. Everyone in LA is hustling, trying to find new ways to make it, etc. Here is SF, everyone seems convinced they have already made it - Ivy League degree in hand, they are competing for Social Worker jobs in Oakland (to save those less 'privileged' than themselves) and need the just right guy to shoe horn into their Life Plans. LA women, and given the significantly larger population, they are much much more varied as a group, seem much more focused on what they want to do as opposed to what they have to prove, and seem more open to seeing where a relationship takes them as opposed to whether or not it fits into a preconceived notion of how things 'should' be.SF women are, on average, 'smarter' and more well read, far more educated, but lack the sense of humor and open mindedness the LA women have. In SF it always feels like people are trying to fit into each other's perfect life plans, where as in LA everyone is trying to figure out how to survive and make tomorrow a little better and more interesting - looking to find the next great thing as opposed to feeling like they have to prove that they have already built the best thing.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 40, 'answer_user': 'David Kaye'}, {'answer': 'I\'m a L.A. girl but am going to answer this anonymously because I know I\'ll be every kind of vapid bitch in the book after this - but I\'m also telling the truth according to how I see it.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s my L.A. and S.F. connection: I\'m from L.A., I went to Stanford, I lived in SF after undergrad and now I\'m in graduate school in L.A.\xc2\xa0 My ex-boyfriend (who does live in SF) would say that the women in SF dress like men, they don\'t groom or take care of themselves, they dress like they\'re depressed, they don\'t wear heels, etc etc. I used to think it was just Palo Alto, but that whole "I\'m busy doing shit" look extends to S.F. as well. In all honesty, I\'m like a lot of in shape women with a fairly symmetrical face: on any given make-up free day, I\'m a 6 or a 7. With a lot of effort, I can pull it up to a 9. With a professional team, I can make it to an 11. Most women can do this. Most women, with some effort can land in the 7-9 range by doing something as simple as grooming their eyebrows, painting their nails, wearing something fitted and getting a really good haircut that complements their facial structure. The biggest difference in L.A. and S.F. women is that L.A. women know that it\'s possibly to look like a 10 or even better. I don\'t believe that S.F. women really believe it. I feel like they\'re kind of stuck in the 5-7 range and anything above that which requires effort is "being fake". Perception is reality.Women in S.F. also take their degrees and their careers way too seriously. I mean, I get it - be proud of it. I\'m really proud of mine too.

And I totally get that there\'s that whole "women can\'t code" attitude in some spaces and that has a lot to do with it. In L.A., because the industries are much more diverse and the dominant industry in town (Hollywood) has plenty of women in positions of power, I don\'t feel that women in L.A. feel that they have to walk into a room proving anything.

And hoodies are best left to Mark Zuckerberg. Women in SF wear them all the time and most women in L.A. wouldn\'t be caught dead wearing one out socially, for real. It\'s like, "What\'s the point of slaving over the treadmill if I\'m just going to cover it all up?" I get that SF gets cold. Invest in a nice and tailored blazer and a cute scarf though. Because most of your competition, other SF women, look like they raided their little brother\'s closet, by just dressing with a little feminine effort, you can blow a good 85% of your competition out of the water. If you are a well groomed, well put together woman (hetero or homosexual) in SF, the dating pool is your oyster. Another thing. My ex was way too impressed that I got Brazilians, my hair blown out and my nails and toes done regularly. In L.A., that\'s standard. No man here has ever been impressed by that. In fact, there are men in L.A. that won\'t even date a woman if she doesn\'t do those things. Men in S.F. were genuinely, deeply impressed by this. My ex (we\'re really good friends now) actively complains that he has not had a girlfriend in SF since that regularly waxed or got regular blow outs. I hear a lot of SF women say that they don\'t have time do this stuff, but that\'s why God invented Dry Bar. (Drybar, The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Premier Blow Out Salon and Blow Dry Bar) L.A. women are total devotees.\xc2\xa0 I know this sounds like I\'m about to set the women\'s movement back a good 60 years, but there\'s an enormous power in the vagina and a great way to maximize that "sphere of influence" (but certainly not the only way) is to keep it interesting down there. In L.A., there are tons of waxing, sugaring, laser and trimming options to try and experiment with. Good sex and good visuals can\'t make a relationship last, but I\'ll be damned if it doesn\'t go a very long way, especially when a guy knows that he can\'t just go out anywhere and find a girl that\'s willing to do all of that. Women that don\'t consistently groom are leaving power on the table. Lean in ladies, lean in. I\'ve also heard women in S.F. just don\'t get the concept of lingerie. American women in general have a problem with this, but I think women in L.A. do better than most in this department. I think women in L.A. better understand that men are visual creatures and my girlfriends in L.A. really understand this. We actively talk about lingerie, who is having a sale, the thongs at Target versus Cosa Bella, etc etc. I never had those conversations in S.F. with any of my girlfriends. I honestly felt like an idiot having an extended conversation about it. Women in L.A., by and large don\'t see La Perla, Agent Provocateur and Eberjey as being a waste of money; they see it as an investment. If you feel sexy, you exude sex appeal and confidence, which people pick up on. I don\'t think S.F. women have gotten the memo on the ROI of lingerie. Women in L.A., the ones that haven\'t piled their faces with Botox and Mac foundation understand that the "natural" look really isn\'t that natural. Some women in L.A. have a lot of time to go all into it - the concealer, the eyelash curling, etc etc. Women in S.F. are too busy for that and I think every day, it\'s kind of a waste. But, I do think that a lot of women in S.F. take the "natural" look too literally - by actually going natural. The natural look really isn\'t natural at all; it\'s a subtle blush (usually Orgasm by NARS) or bronzer, mascara, lip gloss and if you\'re feeling really jazzy, a brush of eye shadow. A lot of sun kissed, yogis in L.A. that have that fresh bikram glow really just have a very well (read: discreetly) painted face. This may sound like I\'m hating on SF women. I\'m not. Without question, SF has the smartest consolidation of women on the West Coast and I love that women in SF really help other women and take that mission to heart. It\'s definitely not like that in L.A. The women in the City by the Bay that I\'ve met in school, work and just living in the city are some of the funniest, smartest women that are into the most random (in a good way) things and interests. The men in SF should be so lucky to have them. I just think there are a few things, visually, that women in SF could do to better market their awesomeness. I know that women in L.A. get a reputation for not being that smart, but in the visual and dating department, I definitely think the ladies up North could learn a thing or two from the ladies down South.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 111, 'answer_user': 'Renat Aksitov'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2013, 9, 9, 7, 4), 'tag': ['Los Angeles vs. San Francisco', 'Comparing Cities', 'Los Angeles, CA', 'San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Francisco', 'Women', 'Dating and Relationships'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

I\'ve visited both. I live in the South Bay, Silicon Valley. (Psst... there\'s stuff to see here, too, but you may require transportation that is not the public sort, and a bit of digging, to see it.) Other caveat: I\'m not a big-city person. My suburban existence gets punctuated by trips to more rural areas of California at least as often as by trips to the city. Before we begin, a public service announcement about SF Bay Area weatherI took this photo of the Golden Gate Bridge (and Civil War era Fort Point, underneath it, which I also recommend visiting) in June. It\'s probably about 15C here. Even if the peninsula or inland valleys are sweltering in summer\'s heat, you will want at least a light jacket for SF and the coast. The gift shop makes much of its money selling sweatshirts to chilly tourists who have heard of "sunny California." That cloudless panorama you have seen of this same bridge was most likely taken in November or February. The SF Bay Area is a very diverse place, and as such doesn\'t summarize well. I live here, and I suspect I\'m biased a little towards here. We have nature and arts, high tech and history. Our oldest structure in town, whether north or south, is apt to be the mission established by the Spanish in the 1700-1800s. El Camino Real connects the missions, built at intervals of about 20 miles, to be a day\'s journey apart. Of course, those missions were generally constructed by the native populations that were here first, but it\'s worth seeing some original adobe, if you visit. (This is at Mission Santa Clara de As\xc3\xads.)For nature, if you are so inclined, see if you can get yourself north of San Francisco, into the Marin Headlands or up to Muir Woods or Mount Tamalpais. Or, head south to Santa Cruz and take in the redwoods in Henry Cowell park. There are numerous lesser known parks around and between. From some of the peaks in the Russian Ridge (midway along the peninsula) you can see most of the bay on a clear day.I am not the right person to comment on bars and night life, but I am told both exist, particularly in the city. Certainly both San Francisco and San Jose have art galleries and museums of various sorts, plus a wide assortment of shopping, from gigantic shiny malls to quirky used bookstores. Tech is harder to see unless you\'re looking for it. Most of the tech firms don\'t really invite visitors. Intel may be an exception, with a free museum at their Santa Clara facility. Apple does have a store at One Infinite Loop in Cupertino. Otherwise, if you wish to see Google or Yahoo! or eBay or what-have-you, the most you\'re likely to get is a photo of the outside of the building and the sign. One better choice is the Computer History Museum in Mountain View (about 45 minutes\' drive south of San Francisco). If you\'re there, you may want to stop at the NASA Ames visitor center, too. (Big hint: ask questions and get the volunteer docents talking.) See Which places should a technophile visit on a trip to San Francisco and Silicon Valley? for vastly more information.I\'ll plug just a couple of my other favorite places to visit. Both are in Alameda, in the East Bay. One is the Aircraft Carrier USS Hornet Museum. It\'s an entire aircraft carrier, now docked. Allow a full day, if you go. It\'s basically a floating city, and the flight decks and many of the public nooks and crannies feature museum exhibits on various themes. There\'s even an Apollo space capsule. The other is the Pacific Pinball Museum, which is exactly what it sounds like. The admission fee lets you stay and play all but the oldest and feeblest couple of something like 90 pinball machines, from the very early days to the present. The LA area also isn\'t just Los Angeles, but a sprawl of city and suburbs. If you go, be sure to see the Getty Center (either/both of them) and the Huntington, unless you have no interest in anything museum-like. Disneyland, too, if you are so inclined. I also enjoyed the La Brea tar pits and the nearby Peterson Automotive Museum (which features, among other things, several famous movie cars). There are certainly other landmarks and places to visit, but I am not so familiar with that area. These are just the ones that stick out in my mind.As Garrick says, the two are not so far apart, and a short flight will get you from one to the other.

Dating in LA is like the city itself: fake. People date each other for a reason--because they want something from you, be it money, drugs, fame, sex, or status. Then again, dating in LA can be fun because there are no feelings involved. Being single in LA can also be fun because it's a very self-centered subculture. People are more adventurous and since you're dealing with a more attractive population, you have to work harder to look better, which can do wonders for your self-esteem (of course, it can also have the opposite effect if you waste your time trying to compare yourself to women who are supernatural). I've never dressed, looked, or felt better than when I lived in LA. Also, I never felt bad about being single in LA because I could tell that 99% of relationships around me were also fake. I actually felt like I was the only one living in reality and being true to myself by being by myself and making myself happy.Being single in SF, on the other hand, is a little more difficult in terms of jealousy over others' relationships. Here, I've seen genuine relationships develop--not based on looks and fame but more on intellect and genuine happiness. Living in SF, I could let my eyebrows grow out, wear less makeup, put on a couple of pounds, and wear North Face jackets everywhere, and I'd still get asked out (doing any of this in LA might imply that I was homeless). That's not to say that there isn't a fair amount of status-seeking in SF; after all, people are smarter here. True story.Being in a relationship in SF is pure bliss. The weather is colder, which is conducive to snuggling up. And, because people are generally bundled up, showing skin is actually a rare commodity around here (in other words, it will definitely get you noticed, assuming you're remotely attractive and not one of those weird hippies who runs around naked anyway). People are generally more fit around here versus simply anorexic, so adventure abounds. Conversations tend to be more intellectual, which is a nice contrast to the superficial LA vernacular.

Here are a few notes:-Virgin America and United both use SFO as a hub, so will probably have the highest volume of flights available (JetBlue also has a high volume of flights, but it's technically not a hub for them, and I haven't flown with them in a while)-United flies a special service called p.s. (SFO-JFK and LAX-JFK only), which is a full three-class aircraft (including the only first class lie-flat beds on US domestic routes). All economy seats are 'Economy Plus' and come with wifi/power in the seats. Try to avoid any United flights that are not designated 'p.s.' (i.e. any indirect flights, or flights to EWR), because they will not have wifi/power, and the seats will be extraordinarily cramped :(-I haven't flown Delta on this route, but I can tell you Virgin America has notably better service than any other airline I've flown on this route, and you can't beat the consistency of their amenities (you should expect every Virgin flight to have wifi, in-seat power, good service, leather seats, personal media screens, decent food options)-Virgin America's personal media screens are very unique in the industry, if entertainment is a priority. They have a great selection of on-demand music (free), TV (live: free, on-demand: $) and films ($) on personal touchscreens, which you can also use to order food.-Virgin now has a mileage redemption partnership with Virgin Atlantic, so you finally have some other options for earning miles with an international airline network.-If you are trying to upgrade on your flight, Virgin also has a unique option. If First Class is not sold out six hours before the flight, you can upgrade from Main Cabin (economy) for $299 (*updated price as of late 2011). I don't know of any other airline that offers this. Conversely, however, frequent fliers do not get automatically bumped up to First, as far as I know.I unequivocally recommend Virgin America if you can find a decent fare (they usually have good fares with advanced purchase), but you will certainly want to take into account the broader frequent flier and culture questions.

Delta and Virgin America have in-seat power and personal TVs with TV and movies as well. On a pure features perspective Delta and Virgin America win out.Legroom/comfort:United and JetBlue have the most legroom, at around 34" each. This can make a big difference for some people on long trips.Network/FF Program:If you\'ll be flying many other routes/international routes as well, the network size and frequent flyer program can be important. A good FF program will get you upgraded into first class pretty regularly. Any of the three legacy carriers (United, Delta, American) will have excellent networks for lots of other flights. Consensus tends to be that United and American have slightly better Frequent Flier programs, but I actually find I get upgraded to first on Delta pretty regularly (I\'m a Gold, the mid-tier). If you do this route a lot, American will let you get to Platinum fast through their Platinum Challenge.Customer Service/In-flight Staff:You\'ll find examples of terrible service on all the airlines, but generally the staff is better on the newer airlines, namely JetBlue and Virgin America. Also, United is the only service to offer meal service on the flight, if that\'s important to you.It\'s also worth noting that Virgin America has gone for a very cool/hip/sexy feel, which makes the flight feel a little like a nightclub.

This is to make sure that it is able to safely withstand the stresses due to the weight of the engines attached on the wings. Even the fuel tank in the larger wet-wing type planes is embedded in the wings. The over wing exits provide you with a fast way to deplane during an emergency. The wing structure also saves you during a crash by absorbing a part of the impact energy due to progressive buckling. With all these arguments in mind, I always choose a seat near the wings when I fly and suggest you to do the same.

I think the drawback is they\'re picking up other people at those hours and you end up having to leave your house way too early. :(The cab ride for a 6am flight would pick you up around 4:40am. It\'ll run you about $32 bucks plus tip. (I live near 500 Club so that\'s pretty close to you.) I think this is reasonable, since for about $15 more you get a much more reliable service than a "friend," and it gets you to the airport pretty quickly (about 20-25 minutes). If you have taken cabs in LA, you will be thankful for a $32 cab fare. Uber - about $60. If this is an expensable situation, or if you don\'t mind the extra cost then this is (sort of) worth it. Otherwise not really.Task Rabbit - you can post this request and set your own price.

You can probably make it to the airport in time for a 6am flight, but you are cutting it close. American Airporter is another good alternative. Lorries Airport Shuttle is the local GO Brand and is another good option.SuperShuttle generally gets bad reviews because they cart you all over the entire city at times. If you pick a provider like Airport Express SF, which does not serve the Sunset or Richmond neighborhoods, or anything west of the Presidio, you are much less likely to be carted around the city on your way to the airport.

They even have services that they are planning on attaching like having a warm meal for you in the car so you can avoid airport food. They claim to be able to satisfy any time of the day, so that is a good option for early rides, and unlike other rideshare services like UberX, Sidecar and Lyft, Tickengo specializes in airports and takes advanced reservations.Another option is Flightcar (http://www.flightcar.com), which allows you to drive your car to the airport, park it there for free, and make money by letting them rent out your car. It's part of the whole collaborative consumption/economy trend, but you need to be willing to lend out your car to randoms.

I admit this is an improbable situation, because there are two pilots (at least for now), and I do not imagine any situation that one of them, even very sick, would not prefer to try to land the plane by him/herself than to handle it over to a passenger, but, let us imagine, for the sake of the answer, that you, a passenger, decide to go for it. So, you enter the cockpit, pilots are nowhere to be seen, you sit on the left seat (pilot in command), all the lights are green (if not, forget about a safe end of your trip) and all the passengers and the rest of the crew are cheering at you.Well, you need first to identify the primary instrumentsIt seems complex.. this is and old fashioned (and rather battered) DC9 cockpit, now cockpits are digital, some of them still have analog instruments, some of them have all the analog instruments replaced by a single screen, the "primary flight display indicator", which concentrates all the information you need and I refer to later, on a single instrumentYou, the non-pilot sitting on the left seat, need to start doing something to land safelySo let us start indentifying the radioThe radio is located on a commercial plane on the pedestal, which is the central panel, in between pilot and copilot. It is usually labelled Comm (unless you are on a soviet plane, of course). You should identify the frequency (it should show something between 108 and 136... this is the civil aviation band frequency). You locate a microphone (hanging somewhere), you press the button (do not forget to press to talk) or you locate on the yoke a button labelled transmit (the yoke is the funny horned thing in front of you) and you say: "mayday, mayday, this is (put here the letters and numbers that are clearly labelled in front of you, on a kind of sheet of metal, in this case A/C 9760), mayday". Either you have a response or not. If not, you should find on the radio set how to change the frequency and set it to 121.5 which is the emergency frequency all the aircraft community is hearing and repeat your distress call. You say that you are a non pilot, and you follow their instructions...They will ask you to locate theseOf course they will not look exactly the same (1 will be different, 4 will be (probably) hidden somewhere, but to locate 1 (it is the most important, the airspeed indicator), you must find it, usually it says "knots" somewhere, unless, of course, if the aircraft is built in Russia, or it is a sailplane. But, let us continue. On the airspeed indicator there is a "safe" zone (green or labelled differently). While you are in it, your speed is OK. Then you should locate 6, it is called the "variometer" and it tells you if your aircraft goes up or down (or, hopefully, stays levell). You will recognize it because the needle 0 position is at 9 or 3 (and probably it says "up" and "down" nearby). You did\'nt touch anything yet, did you? If the plane has a FDI (Flight display indicator) the same information should appear on it (attitude, airspeed, altitude, variometer)Finally, to flight your plane, you still need to know something about 2 or 4. 2 is called "attitude indicator" or "artificial horizon", 4 "Turn coordinator", 4 seems to be kept for sentimental reasons and / or old fashioned pilots :). Those are the most counterintuitive instruments, because an aircraft is not like a car. On a car, if you change direction on the front wheels, the car turns, if you descend a hill, the front of the car is lower than the rear. A plane may descend while it remains perfectly horizontal, or even in a "nose up" attitude. Or it may go forward on a straight line while the tail is off-center and the plane banks... so, you need to have the attitude indicator "centered" (you will see some kind of fixed mark - on 2, the big red arrow - tied to the aircraft and an moving part, half in blue, like the sky, and half in brown, like the ground.Hopefully, air controllers have you already on their radar, so they know where you are, and what altitude are you flying. With the indicators 1, 3, 4 and 6 you should be able to fly a plane (if you recognize your surroundings, of course, if not, you should add a compass (5) and a watch)Air controllers will probably ask you what course you follow. This will be provided by the compass, this is an indicator labelled between 0 and 33,\xc2\xa0 usually in increments of 3, and probably with N, E, S and W. Do not expect to find N or 0 on the 12 clock position, because sometimes (like in 6) the compass moves, and 0 clock position gives you the course. And sometimes North is at 12, and a needle shows your course.And then, probably you should take the yoke, put your feet on the two pedals, and - following instructions - although by now, two or three fighters will be flying near you, with their finger at the trigger - disconnect the autopilot, cross your fingers, and start aiming to the most suitable airport (the one with the longest and widest runway, on the same course you follow).Good luck!Embed QuoteVia  Santosh Desiraju.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Carlos Griell Ventosa'}, {'answer': 'The safest way to crash land is straight ahead.

Note that people who have to helped on to the wheelchair have to wait till all the passengers offload. Therefore if the passenger can walk even a bit, they should exit with the rest of the passengers and locate the attendants outside to save a bunch of time. Her bags were unloaded fairly early. She identified her 2 bags and a second staff member loaded them on a trolley and escorted her to Customs.\xc2\xa0 On my Mom\'s request the first staffer placed a call on the staffers cell phone to my friend who was waiting outside. She asked if my friend would like to escort my mom but she asked they stick to the plan.\xc2\xa0 It was agreed that the staff member would take my mom from the International terminal to T3 and my friend may or may not get an opportunity to spot her at the domestic security checkpoints for United gates there.

(This makes me sad) The common public transit solution for this is taking BART from the airport to the Millbrae Intermodal Terminal. The only BART-Caltrain direct connection is at Millbrae. If you're heading north into San Francisco, I recommend just taking BART (it depends on where you're going, but there's few places I'd recommend transferring from BART to Caltrain to head to San Francisco).Before about 7pm on work weekdays, you need to take BART north from SFO to San Bruno, and then south from San Bruno to Millbrae. This should take about 15 minutes. Trains run about every 15 minutes.After about 7pm on weekdays, on weekends, and holidays, you can take BART from SFO directly to Millbrae. This should take about 4 minutes, and trains run every 15 - 20 minutes.The map should explain why there is this sillyness http://bart.gov/stations/index.aspxEither way, it's $4.05. At Millbrae, if you're heading south on Caltrain, you will walk upstairs, exit BART, then walk to the southbound platform. If you're heading to a northbound Caltrain, you'll probably just be able to walk across the platform.There are other options, depending on where you're going (if you aren't wedded to Caltrain).

Every beyond-perimeter route has to be approved by the DOT. There were some changes as part of the FAA reauthorization that Obama signed into law in February.Four incumbent airlines were allowed to swap a within perimeter route for a beyond perimeter route.

{'qid': 377, 'ans_num': 4, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why is San Francisco International Airport abbreviated as SFO?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'Most airports in the US have a three-letter International Air Transport Association (IATA, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAT...) code, which is an identifier used to refer to the airport in online booking and consumer-facing operations. These codes don\'t often end in I (for International) or A (for Airport) because most codes would be entitled to end that way and it would leave us fewer codes to use [see below for some exceptions]. Instead, a system of abbreviations similar to postal abbreviations for US states has been developed, where the final letter of a name can be used in its abbreviation. So I suspect the O in SFO comes from the final letter of \'San Francisco\'. The pages linked to below refer to many examples where letters throughout the airport name (not necessarily letters near the beginnings of words) are used in the abbreviation. One example is EWR for Newark.Nevertheless, there are exceptions to the rule of "no I\'s or A\'s to mean the obvious things". The original code for Dulles International Airport outside of DC was DIA, but that was too easy to confuse with the nearby DCA, especially when the codes were handwritten, so the code was changed to the current, somewhat unintuitive, IAD. [ http://www.skygod.com/asstd/abc.... ] DCA [DC Airport] and BWI [Baltimore Washington International] also seem to be exceptions to the regularity.Some IATA codes have interesting etymologies. Chicago\'s O\'Hare International, formerly the busiest airport in the world, is ORD, because "before the\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 editor and publisher of the Chicago Tribune, Colonel Robert McCormick\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 suggested a name change as tribute to pilot Lt.

[http://www.skygod.com/asstd/abc.... ].You might wonder why San Jose International is SJC and not SJO or SJE. In that case, the reason is that SJO was taken by San Jose, Costa Rica. The C in SJC seems to be for California, though that is only a guess [ http://airportcitycodes.com/code... -- this link, like the other, contains a lot of code history].There also exist codes for regions with multiple airports -- e.g. LON for all of the London-area airports (Heathrow LHR, Gatwick LGW, Stanstead STN, Biggin Hill BQH, Luton LTN, and London City LCY) and NYC (JFK, LGA, EWR).Internally to the aviation industry (e.g. aeronautical charts), ICAO identifiers are more commonly used.\xc2\xa0 These are 4-character identifiers, assigned regionally.\xc2\xa0 In many cases, mainland US ICAO codes are the IATA identifier prefixed with K, e.g. SFO is KSFO and PAO (Palo Alto) is KPAO.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 60, 'answer_user': 'Ben Golub'}, {'answer': 'The abbreviations originated with railroad telegraphers and dispatchers whose communications served to prevent scheduling conflicts and disastrous accidents.\xc2\xa0 Three-letter abbreviations were necessary from the earliest days to avoid such confusions as SF: Santa Fe or San Francisco.The abbreviations were adopted by early pilots who wanted/needed not to disappear unnoticed if they went down enroute.\xc2\xa0 Early pilots tended to navigate by following railroads anyway, and the telegraph system was almost always associated with those routes.When aeronautical flight planning and flight-following systems (formal arrangements that succeeded the individual air mail pilot\'s dropping by the telegraph offiice before takeoff) were adopted, the US Civil Aeronautics Administration\'s maps showed the airport locations, labeled with the abbreviation, and its spatial relationship to the city or town.\xc2\xa0 Abbreviations ending in A\xc2\xa0 were parts of the location name, since all of the locations were an airport, airfield or airdrome.When international commercial air transport services were initiated, the first international cooperation arrangements were put in place.\xc2\xa0 Aircraft radio "stations" were seen as just another type of radio stations, and their call-sign indicators were regulated by the international telecommunications conventions, which allocated initial letters as an identifier of nationality.\xc2\xa0 The CAA and other aeronautical authorities agreed that aircraft registrations would use the radio callsign, which is why US aircraft use N-numbers and [Great] Britain\'s registry numbers start with G-, etc.\xc2\xa0 The Aviation Fixed Telecommunications Network, established to send safety messages and flight plans, adopted standard format messages using the "four-letter" airport identifiers mentioned by Ben Golub, and these identifiers use the initial nationality or region indicator as well.\xc2\xa0 US radio call signs can start with N, A, K or W, so four-letter airfield designators start with K.\xc2\xa0 Exceptions are airfields in Hawaii, whose four-letter airport codes start with P, designating Pacific Region.The Canadian airports\' four-letter designators start with C, for Canadian Region, and the three-letter suffix matches the three-letter Y?? airport designator that was originally assigned by the UK CAA when it administered Canadian aeronautical facilities.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Jim Gordon'}, {'answer': 'Because it serves the entire SF / Oakland region.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Marc Hoag'}, {'answer': "A very simple way to decifer the airport codes, is you'd need to know the names of many of them to get it.\xc2\xa0 In Canada all airport codes start with Y and have only a coincidental relevance to the city they serve.\xc2\xa0 YYC - Calgary, YVR - Vancouver, YYZ - Toronto...The rest of the world has a seemingly more logical approach, though, as some\xc2\xa0 posters noted with many codes taken and can't be repeated, some make more sense than others.\xc2\xa0 Also as city names change, the codes won't, for ease of everything.\xc2\xa0 See BOM - Mumbai (formerly Bombay), SGN - Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).\xc2\xa0 Many make sense if you give it a quick thought, SFO is a good example, LAX another, AMS...take your best shot.At the end of the day there's no perfect answer beyond the fact that everytime an airport is opened it needs a 3 letter code, as more open we run out of options, some make sense, BOS - Boston some don't TXL - Berlin Tegel.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Brett Armstrong'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2010, 7, 24, 15, 55), 'tag': ['San Francisco International Airport (SFO)', 'How Did X Geographical Location Get Its Name?', 'Abbreviations', 'Airports', 'Etymology'], 'question_user': 'Ben Golub'}

Landing fees at SFO are based on weight, with a minimum landing fee of $127 (http://www.flysfo.com/web/page/d...).You would be parking at the only FBO, Signature Flight Support, so you wouldn\'t pay any terminal fees, however parking at Signature is likely to be just as expensive. Usually though, you get a discount or free parking for the first night for buying a minimum amount of fuel ($6.49/gal at Signature compared with $5.10/gal at San Carlos airport).ATC will let you land at SFO (the only restriction is that student pilots must have an endorsement from their instructor to fly into the "class Bravo" airspace), but they will likely make you hold or give you delay vectors until there is a break in traffic where they can bring you in without impeding following traffic. A 172 can easily approach at 90 or 100kts, then bring in full flaps and slow to 65kts about 200ft above the runway for landing (I do this all the time with instrument approaches). A 747 can slow down to 125kts with 30 degrees of flaps and gear down, so ATC can work these things out.With San Carlos airport (SQL) so close, the only reason to land at SFO is to say you did. The taxi time alone would discount any advantage of being closer to the city.While, I\'ve never landed at SFO, I was previously based at HOU - Houston Hobby (a busy class Bravo airport) and flown into MSY - New Orleans International, and CLT - Charlotte/Douglas International.Below is a video of a trip into CLT:Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 19, 'answer_user': 'Andrew Stagg'}, {'answer': 'I took a tour of SFO Tower a while ago, and they said that there was someone operating a Cessna 182 out of the airport, and that it\'s pilot had gotten accustomed to the issues of operating out of such a busy environment.The main difficulty would be being prepared enough.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how they would assign a pattern entry or merge you in with existing traffic, and there are no notes on this on the airport guide that I use.\xc2\xa0 My guide does say that pilots are encouraged to request a long landing for the 28 runways so that\xc2\xa0 they can touch down west of "The Ones" (1L and 1R) to minimise the taxi time to the FBO (Signature Flight Support).\xc2\xa0 When doing this there is an issue with jet blast and wake turbulence from aircraft taking off on 1L and 1R, as well as through all aspects of taxi, run-up and subsequent takeoff.It\'s a good idea to talk to the tower ahead of time in order to work out a schedule that won\'t put you in conflict with a lot of commercial traffic.\xc2\xa0 SFO has busy and quiet times, which are set up to facilitate transfers for airlines that hub there, so it can make a big difference when you come in.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes the airspace is busy enough that they won\'t even allow traffic to transition north or south through the Bravo airspace.

Also ORD\'s terminals are dirty, noisy, seriously lacking power outlets and near-impossible to sleep in (I slept overnight there for 5hrs once, it made sleeping on the floor of JFK T3 seem like the Hilton, honest). The terminal staff have a screw-you attitude. Traffic to/from ORD sucks, and it is impossible to drive or transfer ORD-MDW in a deterministic amount of time (for a connection), it\'s more reliable to simply fly all the way to New York or wherever.ORD is a notoriously crappy city for delays and cancellations due to both weather and air traffic (#4 on 11 Worst US Airports for Layovers).

Why?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'First of all, the number of flights at many airports is actually increasing over the past few years, so it is probably incorrect to say that "there are decreases in the rest of the country." The airport in Milwaukee, as an example, has seen an increase of 130% in passenger traffic from 2010 to 2011. Still, airport traffic rises and falls over time because airlines go out of business, consolidate flights due to mergers or increase traffic due to demand. Of course, one cannot compare the size of the Milwaukee airport to that of San Francisco.My friend David Litwak\'s answer seems to have logic to it but I am not entirely sure that is the whole story. If there are so many top tech companies located in the area and in Silicon Valley, then how come the airport at San Jose (SJC), located right in Silicon Valley has only seen modest changes (1.3%) in passenger traffic? The logic says it should be booming, but it isn\'t.

The link below has pictures of the devices. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/bl...The rule is that if you're in a lane with the strip search machine and you choose to opt out, then you get punished by being groped.

I was flying back from Kauai and there were two lanes side by side. The metal detector lane moved much faster than the strip search lane, yet people would go through both.This huge difference also illustrates how this is all for show. If there were a true threat that these procedures prevented, all metal detector only lanes should require the enhanced pat downs. Given the interconnectedness of our airport system, all you have to do is find the weakest link. (Although Boston Logan gets a lot of the blame for 9/11, several of the hijackers connected from another airport.)An alternative, for those who want to challenge the system, is to go through the pat down and file an assault complaint.

It is nicer than the international terminal, which is saying something, and there is no comparison to T1 or T3. The entry hall is sunlight down from a high ceiling. The check in areas are wood-paneled, which gives the check in process a less adversarial feeling. Virgin America\'s, in particular, use low tables instead of high counters, and contemporary computer equipment with design-conscious finishes, to project friendliness during what is often a stressful experience. Security is security. It\'s cleaner, but not otherwise different from other terminals. Post-security is where things get truly nice. You enter a wide, well-light "recompose area" with long couches you can use to put your shoes back on etc. If you look up there\'s a fun piece of art meant to evoke the sky (and, I think, fishing nets). Then as you work your way down towards the gates you notice two things: 1. "wow, this place is really clean, wide, high-ceilinged and sunlit for an airport", and 2. "these are some of the nicest airport concessions I\'ve seen". If the most downmarket food concessions at your terminal are Andale and Pinkberry, you\'re doing well. At the top of the range there\'s a branch of the Plant Cafe Organic, a Lark Creek Grill and something called Napa Farms Market, which I think is grab-and-go food, but whose design is supposed to evoke the Ferry Building (really!) OK, it\'s not the French Laundry, but this is an airport... There\'s even a "hydration station" where you can fill your empty bottle post-security with filtered water.The gate areas have high quality seats, including several Jacobsen egg chairs. There are rows of laptop tables and literally hundreds of power sockets to satisfy the average bay area resident\'s gadget-charging needs. The gate numbering is a bit odd. They have 14 gates and had to squeeze them in between T1 and T3\'s existing gate numbers, so there are 3 gates designated 54: 54A, 54B and 54C. The exterior of the building is great too. The two wings of the building are decorated with massive pixellated murals. The whole thing was built with sustainability in mind. I think it will be the first LEED Gold-certified airport terminal in the country. Instead of climate control ducts the walls "breathe" (if you get close to the metal panels on the walls you can see that they\'re perforated). The only meh part is baggage claim. There was apparently no way to make it radically different from the original 1950s design, so the ceilings are low, and it feels a lot like T1. But it is at least clean, brightly painted and so on.

{'qid': 392, 'ans_num': 2, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why does BART charge $4 more for a ride to SFO than to Millbrae from any point in the system?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'The $4 surcharge to go to the SFO BART station was part of BART\'s system-wide fare increases in 2009 that included a 6% overall fare increase [1]. The idea was that it was a good way to increase revenue without affecting daily commuters. BART\'s passenger fares cover over 50 percent of their operating budget [2], which is actually very good for a public transportation agency. For comparison, the passenger fares received in the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Agency (VTA) only account for about 10% of their operating budget [3]. So the airport surcharges are one part of creating a more responsible budget and operation plan while keeping the system accessible for commuters. I\'m always a little bit surprised when I can say a public agency is acting responsibly... good job, BART.And in response to Toni Shuma\'s questions, I did a bit of fun research with BART\'s public records: * The original FY10 budget included this fare increase and many other budget cuts to account for "the worst recession ever experienced by BART". However, BART employees threatened to strike due to the labor cuts that were planned. After labor negotiations were settled, the revised budget was published in early 2010. [13]So- in answer to the question of did this increased fare result in either increased revenue or decreased ridership: There was a large dip in riders between 2009 and 2011, but BART attributes this to the recession, not a direct correlation to fare increases (but could be related). In 2010 and 2011, BART was conservative on their estimates of operating revenue (probably due to the obvious dips in ridership), but their actual revenue has increased each year regardless of actual ridership.Note- the Average Revenue per Rider was just a fun metric I wanted to see, but\xc2\xa0 can be misleading, as there are even more variables that would go into average fare collected per BART rider (length of trip, more paid parking available, etc)[1] SFO Commission Calls BART Surcharge for SFO Workers \xe2\x80\x9cUnconscionable\xe2\x80\x9d[2] http://www.bart.gov/docs/financi...

Which they are, really, as they\'re brand new planes.Seat Comfort: Double-check at www.seatguru.com, but most of their seats have 1" to 2" more leg room than most competing airlines, and their Main Cabin Select seats are 34" to 36" if I remember correctly. Combined with remarkably thin seat backs, and no floor-installed entertainment boxes, leg room is really quite good. The biggest issue I have with their seats are the actual seat cushions -- I think I\'ve sat on more comfortable rocks. They really are quite firm, though not to the point of being actually uncomfortable. That said, Southwest\'s plush seats take the cake: by far and away the most comfortable on domestic carriers.Frequent Flyer Program: Because I\'ve been flying with VX so long and so frequently, I\'ve been complaining to them about this forever: their frequent flier program, aside from the rapidity* with which you can accumulate points, is essentially a non-program: not only do you not get any perks for being a frequent flyer, they don\'t even let you upgrade your seat to Main Cabin Select (exit row and front bulkhead seats) or First Class. Having spoken with VX abou this on at least two occasions, they assured me they\'re definitely working on trying to remedy at least one of these matters. Time will tell. That said, when used in conjunction with their Virgin VISA Card (issued by Barclays), you can rack up points very fast indeed.Airline Partner Programs: Besides several of the other airlines in the Virgin franchise, no partnerships exist as yet. So racking up on VX points is really only going to help you on domestic flights for now.Flight Crew: As a male, my response here cannot be anything other than purely subjective and I will therefore make the same disclaimer I tell my girlfriend who agrees fully with me: if I\'m forced to endure a small aluminum and titanium tube with wings with the comfort of a sardine can (I\'m 6\'5" / 2m tall) for up to six hours, I want my flight crew to be professional, friendly, in good spirits, and yes, female and attractive. VX destroys the competition in this regard as it has by far and away the most pleasant and professional flight crew of any domestic carrier.Amenities: Wi-Fi on all planes, sometimes actually fast enough to watch Netflix or engage in webcam calls. AC power at all seats, though you\'ll need to be capable of actually twisting yourself into a pretzel if you want to find and reach the power socket while strapped into your seat. And finally, Virgin\'s famous Linux-based RED entertainment system, a seat-back computer from which you can watch DirecTV, movies, listen to music, order food and drink, etc. The interface is a bit slow and sluggish, but definitely delivers the goods.Flexbility: Terrible. Plain and simple. You only have 24 hours to change or cancel your flight. After that you get a change penalty on top of any difference in fare.Final thoughts compared to other carriers: AA has started installing their new "shell seats" in Economy Class. Google this if you don\'t know what it is. Let me put it this way. Cathay Pacific, heretofore the highest ranked Pacific route airline, recently started installing these seats in all their 747 aircraft. Less than a year later (I have heard, but not yet confirmed) they are already uninstalling them due to passengers\' complaints. For this reason alone, and having been forced to endure these seats on an SFO-BOS-SFO flight, I will never again fly AA until they remove them. UA has the most unfriendly, unprofessional, and just plain grumpy -- not to mention rude -- flight crew I\'ve ever experienced. Delta I\'ve weirdly never had the chance to fly. Continental I\'ve flown infrequently and found them to be quite average despite their stellar reviews (for a legacy airline, anyway). And Southwest definitely has pleasant flight crews although I don\'t care for the "public bus" feeling of their aircraft or cattle call style boarding system. All these factors taken into account, despite a few minor issues, VX really is a new generation of airline and it is still my airline of choice for any domestic flight.---------------------* By "rapidity," I mean that points appear on your account virtually as soon as you earn them.

This more or less rules out mechanical failure as the cause of the crash.With 4 seconds to impact, the pilots got a stall warning from the aircraft due to the airspeed.With 1.5 seconds, the pilots called for a "go around" and tried to increase their speed and altitude to make another approach. It was too late.The pilot at the controls had never flown a 777 into SFO before, although he had landed large jets there. He had 43 hours total at 777 controls. A crew of experienced pilots was on board but none of them noticed what observers on the ground saw (and apparently some passengers on board): That the plane\'s approach was too low.It\'s always hazardous to draw definitive conclusions in a case like this, but it is nearly apparent that an additional 10-20 feet of altitude allows the plane to avoid crashing into the seawall. An additional 10-30 knots of air speed probably causes the descent to slow just enough that the altitude is higher at the time of approach. A recognition of this impending disaster even 10-20 seconds earlier would almost certainly have been enough to avoid this problem.SFO\'s Instrument Landing System was offline at the time of the crash, but conditions were nearly perfect: clear skies, minimal wind. Normally, this kind of landing is completely routine for commercial pilots without the ILS in these kind of conditions. Saturday July 5 was not a routine day.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 255, 'answer_user': 'Mark Rogowsky'}, {'answer': 'As a huge aviation enthusiast, a private pilot myself, and a huge fan of the Triple 7, I at first had the same reaction - how in the world...?Then I\'m hearing about the tail section breaking off while landing and my confusion grows. With you, how in the world?? The 777 is my very favorite jet to fly. I haven\'t heard anything re: fatalities but as of this morning no 777 has crashed with loss of life.All I can add right this second is a pilot friend who was at SFO and turned around when he heard commotion to see what was up didn\'t see the actual "ground joined" moment, BUT seconds afterwards, judging by what he could see, he is thinking it landed short, and speculated the pilot\'s initial response - a quick pullback on the yolk to try and "bunny-hop" onto the runway resulted in an extreme short-of-runway tail strike. At the speed that 777 was landing at, depending on how hard he potentially yanked back on the control\'s...plenty of forces at work there to break off the tail section and then, with drastically-depleted or realistically probably no horizontal or vertical control, it quickly rolled and hit the runway hard (I keep hearing reports it rolled or was in the process of rolling before it hit the runway). Again...how in the world. My friend flies heavies with United, but again it\'s pure speculation right now. And as he said himself, he truly just saw the impact, blurred window, people everywhere in front of him (he is 6\'7" however), smoke and dust covering the crash scene quickly (he DID say "brown dust" interestingly, just remembered that). I can\'t imagine a trained 777 pilot actually trying to bunny-hop a short-of-runway landing to get on the runway. Something I would not have tried at 16 in our 172!

At the time it was landing, the ILS (Instrument Landing System) which includes the glideslope for vertical guidance and the localizer for horizontal guidance was out of service. The pilot was cleared for a visual approach, however, so it was not required.There have been conflicting reports if the PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) which is a series of red and white lights that indicate if you are too high or too low visually was operating or not. Regardless, the pilots would, however, have been able to use a GPS approach to runway if they wanted electronic glide path guidance. The chart for that approach is below:From what we know so far, it's clear that the aircraft was way below a safe glide path causing the landing gear and tail to strike at the seawall at the end of the runway.This statement was from a United Airlines pilot who was holding short of runway 28L at the time of the accident:On July 6, 2013 at approximately 1827Z I was the 747-400 relief F/O on flt 885, ID326/06 SFO-KIX. I was a witness to the Asiana Flt 214 accident. We had taxied to hold short of runway 28L at SFO on taxiway F, and were waiting to rectify a HAZMAT cargo issue as well as our final weights before we could run our before takeoff checklist and depart. As we waited on taxiway F heading East, just prior to the perpendicular holding area, all three pilots took notice of the Asiana 777 on short final. I noticed the aircraft looked low on glidepath and had a very high deck angle compared to what seemed \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d. I then noticed at the apparent descent rate and closure to the runway environment the aircraft looked as though it was going to impact the approach lights mounted on piers in the SF Bay. The aircraft made a fairly drastic looking pull up in the last few feet and it appeared and sounded as if they had applied maximum thrust. However the descent path they were on continued and the thrust applied didn't appear to come soon enough to prevent impact. The tail cone and empennage of the 777 impacted the bulkhead seawall and departed the airplane and the main landing gear sheared off instantly. This created a long debris field along the arrival end of 28L, mostly along the right side of 28L. We saw the fuselage, largely intact, slide down the runway and out of view of our cockpit. We heard much confusion and quick instructions from SFO Tower and a few moments later heard an aircraft go around over the runway 28 complex. We realized within a few moments that we were apparently unharmed so I got on the PA and instructed everyone to remain seated and that we were safe. An experienced Delta Pilot I know provided the following theory (and political commentary):This crew tried to correct heavy sink with further aggrevated back pressure thinking that pulling back would help. Its like our economy. You would think that more taxes, more government programs and increased debt ceiling would effect a correction in the proper direction. The truth is that what we are doing is further aggrevating the problem, just like these guys showed us.Here is an example of a normal landing (not mine) on runway 28L at SFO:As you can see, the aircraft touches down beyond the 1000ft markers (solid white bars) and passes over the end of the runway at a safe altitude of about 50ft.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 48, 'answer_user': 'Andrew Stagg'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2013, 7, 11, 0, 3), 'tag': ['Asiana Flight 214 Crash (July 2013)', 'Boeing 777', 'San Francisco International Airport (SFO)', 'Aviation Accidents and Incidents'], 'question_user': 'Jon Rodriguez'}

It seems to break down to several things:The relative rarity of the event - Even if African and Asian nations where some of the worst maintained commercial airlines routinely fly and are based, crashes are exceptionally rare. In North American and Europe, they are almost non-existent. When they do occur, they often feed into:Confirmation biases - People who dislike or fear flying almost always have their fears and hatred confirmed when a plane crashes. Despite the lottery win levels of chance that it will occur, when it does these people have a willing media ready and able to report the rarity as if it is something which happens far more often.Plane crashes used to end in complete fatalities - Until the late 1980s, the majority of serious crashes , while again rare, end with the deaths of all of the passengers. Since these numbers were usually in hundreds, this made plane crashes exceptional events which the media relished in covering.9/11 - Even now, 12 years after the event, the media consistently reports that a plane crash did not involve terrorism. Since the overwhelming majority of aircraft incidents are either pilot error or mechanical incidents, there really shouldn\'t be a need to report this. But then again, the media is built upon making the exception seem to be the rule.Slow news days - Nothing makes a slow news period seem to be "exciting" like a plane crash. The media can fill several or more news cycles with the relatively rare event and they can cover from all angles from local to international. An aircraft mishap, like the unexpected death of a major celebrity, is tailor-made for full exploitation by the media.When I\'m writing this, there are several continuing conflicts in Africa and Asia, a major train mishap in Quebec,Canada and the on-going weather-related issues due to climate change.

We cede an unusual amount of control when we do so - you can't tell the pilot to stop and let you out, people generally have no idea how a plane works, landmarks can be hard to identify so you can't really see where you are going.

{'qid': 406, 'ans_num': 4, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85What is United Airlines' market share for flights out of SFO?", 'answers': [{'answer': 'Here\'s how United stacks up for the time period Nov 2009-Oct. 2010 based on the metrics published by SFO in CSV format (http://flysfo.com/web/page/about...). All of SFO\'s publications are amenable to pivot tables, so I\'ve broken these metrics out a tiny bit further below.By cargoUnited carried the plurality of cargo (23% of all tonnage) into and out of SFO from Nov. 2009-Oct. 2010:If you wanted to treat the question a little more precisely, you could note that it asks about United\'s market share for flights out of SFO. Well, OK, here are the numbers for flights where cargo is "enplaned" only (only for outbound cargo flights):United holds steady at 23% -- which means that the numbers of tons of cargo entering SFO and leaving SFO on UA planes over this time period were about equal. Pretty cool!By landingsUnited operated 49% of aircraft landings into SFO from Nov. 2009 - Oct. 2010. That\'s not the whole story because flights published as "United" may be operated by Skywest contracted as United Express.Of those 49%, half were operated by United, and half were operated by Skywest on United\'s behalf (United was the publishing, but not the operating, carrier). Here are the numbers showing both publishing carrier and operating carrier.By landed weightThis metric is a little silly.40% of all landed weight at SFO came from United-published flights; of that, most was United-operated but a little bit was Skywest.By passengers (into and out of SFO)United carried 40% of all passengers into and out of SFO from Nov. 2009-Oct. 2010: The above table is a crude summary that doesn\'t quite conform to the actual standard SFO uses for passenger counts. SFO sums up# deplanements + #enplanements + 2 * #thru-transitwhile in this table I have just summed up# deplanements + #enplanements + #thru-transitHere\'s the difference:deplanements - passenger got off any plane in SFOenplanements - passenger got on any plane in SFOthru/transit - passenger got off a plane in SFO, and then got on another plane on the same airline and with the same flight number (these flights are called "direct flights").An example: UA837 refers to both a United flight from DFW to SFO and also a flight from SFO to NRT. The flights are operated by different physical airplanes, but if you take this "direct" flight for both segments, you count as 0 enplanements, 0 deplanements, and 1 thru/transit passenger. You get weighted twice as heavily in "total passenger throughput" numbers.Incidentally, we can measure UA\'s market share on "flights out of SFO", which the question asks, by looking at only # thru/transit + # enplanements.

{'qid': 409, 'ans_num': 2, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85Why does SFO only have 4 runways? Why didn't they build more during one of the boom eras?", 'answers': [{'answer': "SFO's runways have long been a contentious issue. The main problem with SFO's configuration (2 sets of parallel runways) is that the parallel runways are too close to each other (750ft) to allow for simultaneous landings during inclement weather. The FAA mandates that planes doing a parallel landing at SFO must be able to see each other during the landing, which is impossible during cloudy weather. This effectively cuts airport capacity in half, creating major delays. If the parallel runways were farther apart, like they are in LAX, Hong Kong, and London Heathrow, this would be much less of an issue. During the boom of Y2K, SFO's traffic rates were extremely high. In fact in 2000, SFO was the 9th busiest airport in the world and has since fallen to 20th. It was during this period that plans for new runways were resurrected. Since there is no land available in the airport, the plan was to create new parallel runways in the bay by reclaiming more land. The picture below shows what these new runways would look like:http://www.sfba.org/sfo/image1.jpgThis is the current configuration:http://www.sfba.org/sfo/image0.jpgThis of course was met with massive opposition from environmental groups. Reclaiming land in the Bay destroys large animal habitats and disrupts local ecosystems created by tidal movements. Residents were worried that the additional airport capacity offered by new runways would mean more flights that would create more noise and pollution over their homes. Furthermore, a new runway in the bay positioned northeast from the existing 28R runway would send planes over an area that is not under any existing flightpaths, increasing the number of homes that would be affected by airplanes using the airport. Traffic numbers are starting to increase again at SFO and the massive delays will return. Soon there will be renewed calls for runway construction, but the Save the Bay coalitions have so much clout that politicians will likely not give much support to expansion and any attempts will be mired in years of litigation. Before the 1960s, people were adding land in the Bay with little regard for the environment, and the Bay soon turned into a cesspool of chemicals and raw sewage. In fact, since 1770, the Bay has decreased in size by 33% due to land reclaiming (San Francisco's current financial district used to be covered by water). During the 1960s, California passed a series of legislation that made it very difficult to build anything new in the Bay and created the Bay Conservation and Development Commission to ensure the environmental stability of the Bay. So in exchange for a much cleaner Bay than before, getting approval for a new bayside development is a bureaucratic and legal nightmare.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 132, 'answer_user': 'Raj Misra'}, {'answer': "SFO has four runways, two sets of two parallel runways.

I\'ll give my perspective as a man dating women in SF and try to add a little of what I\'ve been told by straight/bi women who are on tinder. I don\'t know enough about the experience for women dating women or men dating men to have any perspective on it.I\'ve used both Tinder and OKCupid, which is a more traditional internet dating site.The general impression is that Tinder is a little less serious, which makes sense--getting on OKCupid involves uploading pictures, writing a profile, and answering questions, whereas on Tinder you just link it to your facebook, select pictures, and go. Relatedly, there\'s somewhat more of an association between Tinder and hookups than with other dating sites, but many people still use it for more traditional dating. I haven\'t had any Tinder hookups (in fairness, I haven\'t been looking for them), but I\'ve had quite a few Tinder dates, and even one short (~3 month) relationship. The other biggest difference between Tinder and other more traditional dating sites is that on OKCupid, women may be messaged by any man with interest--which leads to the most attractive women coming under constant barrage (mostly with low-quality messages like "sup"). Tinder requires that two people "swipe right" on each other before they can communicate; solving this problem.A result of this is that the average attractiveness of girls on Tinder tends to be much higher than on OKCupid, where a lot of the more attractive girls are scared off by the high quantity of messages, many of which are sexually explicit.Tinder also links directly to a facebook profile, making it harder (but not impossible) to create fake profiles. I haven\'t personally used Tinder outside of SF, but most of the women I\'ve talked to about it have stated that it seems like the guys are more active here / better looking than in other cities (we speculate that this is because there are more single guys out here per single girl than in other cities).Embed QuoteVia  Riley Patterson.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Tom Gwinn'}, {'answer': 'It is fun and noncommittal.

I have been running the SF Marathon (2nd half most of the time for about 10, 12 years).\xc2\xa0 A few things to consider:1) Are you local or are you flying in for the race? If you are flying in then staying in SF is perhaps an option and therefore you can get to the 1st half with no problem (starts @ 5:30am!!). If you are a local and say, live in San Jose it's kind of hard to get to a 5:30 am race. It becomes more of a production (get a hotel room in the city, stay with friends, etc). If you like to sleep a few more hours the night before the race, do the 2nd half. 2) Are you looking for a PR? The course is hard and hilly, not the best for a PR. However, if you had to choose one, the 2nd half course is a little better for that. 3) Do you care where the race ends? The first half ends in Golden Gate Park and not at the marathon finish line. In my humble opinion it's kind of anti-climatic to end at Golden Gate Park: not many people cheering, you did not finish with the marathoners, not much of an expo at the park and you might still have to take the shuttle back to the starting/finish line. If you do the 2nd half you finish with the marathoners, tons of people cheering and you are right at the expo. 4) Do you care about the sights? Do you want to run on the Golden Gate? Do you want to run through the Haight? If you care, pick depending on what neighborhood you want to experience. I would recommend running on the Golden Gate at least once. 5) Do you prefer to run in the cool weather (i.e 5:30 am 1st half) or in 'warm' weather (i.e. 8:30 am 2nd half)? I would personally recommend the 2nd half: you don't have to wake up very early for it, you end at the main finish line, the weather (most of the time) is a bit better and the course is less hilly. However, regardless of what half you choose, at the end of the day it's still running and it's still San Francisco; not a bad way to spend a Sunday morning, don't you think?Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Icaro Vazquez'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 25, 14, 30), 'tag': ['The San Francisco Marathon', 'Half Marathons', 'Running', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'James Chong'}

Here\'s Hugh Macleod of http://gapingvoid.com (who does the posters for the annual Techcrunch parties)\xc2\xa0 standing in front of it. Unfortunately you can\'t get past the gate unless you are lucky or know an executive inside HP. We got a tour once, here\'s Brian Solis\' pictures of that day: http://bub.blicio.us/touring-the...Why there? It\'s the birthplace of Silicon Valley and really everything flows out from here. Total time needed? 15 minutes to read the plaque and snap some photos.Next, I\'d head to University Cafe. Say hi to Flipboard as you pass by, along with a few other startups. See the Whole Foods? That\'s where Steve Jobs shops for his groceries. Why is University Cafe important? Well, this is where Ron Conway met Mark Zuckerberg. He invested. The rest is history. I love to sit outside and think about all the porn going underneath the street (I remember when they ripped up the street and laid in tons of fiber heading into Stanford University).If we really want to get double caffeinated, visit Coupa Cafe, nearby. I always run into CEOs and VCs there. After your coffee, head up the street so you can take a photo in front "Lucky 165 University Ave": http://milo.com/blog/lucky-165-u... early office of Google, PayPal, Logitech, and many other startups.Next I\'d take you to Stanford University. We\'ll visit two things here. First, the Cantor Arts Center. http://museum.stanford.edu/ Why? It\'s a great free museum, but holds the key for what made Leland Stanford all the money he needed to buy "the Farm:" the golden spike. See, Silicon Valley started as a railroad town, which explains our next stop after we leave Stanford.From there we\'d visit the chapel in the Quad, where you can see some great stained glass, like this:And learn some of the spiritual reasons why the Stanfords\' donated their money and time to making a great University here (which really led to the development of HP, etc.From there I\'d take you to the Gates Building, which is the home of the Computer Science department. Inside I\'d introduce you to the folks doing bleeding edge photographic research, like what Marc Levoy was doing here:Or the robotic work, or other work. There\'s tons of interesting stuff going on in this building every semester.From there I\'d take you on a tour of tons of different things. If you got the really great tour, we\'d stop over at the Automotive Research labs and try to get a ride in their self-driving car, among other cool projects.Next, I\'d take you to the heart of Silicon Valley. First, let\'s visit the Santa Clara railyard, which has a neat history museum in it (I love one of the photos, which is of the railyard with nothing surrounding it). Next, we\'ll visit the Interlocking Machine, stored in this shed:Inside is one of Silicon Valley\'s first computers. Tons of commuters ride by every day without knowing what a great machine is stored inside. It\'s a mechanical computer. You pull out a slide and tell the system "if this slide is pulled out, then close this rail, else a crash will happen." Programmers will see the "if, then, else" logic carved into metal. Later computers will take over these jobs (the same job now is run from a computer in Omaha, NE).More details about this: http://www.sbhrs.org/ for the museum\'s site and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San... for the wikipedia entry.Under the shed, by the way, runs some strands of fiber to Santa Clara University.That will take an hour to get through, more if you actually got someone to give you a tour of the Interlocking Machine.Next, let\'s head to the Tech Museum. http://www.thetech.org/ This is a neat hands-on museum that is fun to visit and learn about the technology that runs under everything.

Get a milkshake at the Creamery, a slice at Pizza my Heart, and maybe a beer at the Rose & Crown. Once you've digested downtown Palo Alto (this won't take more than an hour or so), head to campus, where there are any number of places you should see. Drive up Palm Drive and park in the oval.First and foremost for a technophile, the Gates Computer Science building is not only the place where many entrepreneurs of the past fifteen years cut their teeth on their way to building Yahoo! and Google and all the others, but also has several wonderful computer history exhibits and the offices of some of the brightest minds in Computer Science today. Across the street is the Packard building, and if you walk around the halls of Gates and Packard looking for open doors, you're more than likely to stumble across a professor or grad student that's more than willing to nerd out with you for a little bit if you only think to ask. Just ask them what they're working on.Another thing that's not to be missed in my opinion is the Silicon Valley family tree poster. I believe it's in the Jackson Business Library down Serra Mall from the engineering quad, although this might be in Gates as well. It's a gigantic poster that tracks Silicon Valley companies and their descendants from Fredrick Terman and Hewlett-Packard, National Semiconductor (be amazed at how many companies they spawned), and Fairchild down through PARC, Apple, MIPS and the rest. I think it goes up until the mid-90's or so. If you're at all interested in the history of the valley you can stare at it for hours.The whole campus is beautiful, you should take the campus tour where the Visitor Information Services guides will tell you the stock stories both fact and legend about the luminaries of the tech world and their times at Stanford. Afterwards, see the Rodin sculpture garden, maybe try to sit and reflect near a fountain somewhere. If you're coming from the northeast, you may never go home.Most importantly, I'd say is try to talk to people.

Looking on Craigslist, you could get a decent room in the city for about $1200 a month. Figure in another $1200 for food and expenses and that brings you up to $4000 a month.

It depends what you want to maximize. If we assume your list is in order -- that weather is really important for your team and proximity to techies isn\'t -- I suggest the East Bay. Someplace in Oakland or Berkeley.Weather: Much better than the city.Co-working: I believe this exists. If not, rents are cheap, by Bay Area standards.There\'s lots of nightlife and interesting things happening, all the time.The mountains and rest of California are one fewer bridge away.Other techies can be found. It\'s not as dense as SoMA, but it\'s not bad either. If not, SoMA is a BART ride away (so get a place very very close to BART! This is very important!)Your second option is the Mission district of SF. The weather is okay, better than many places in SF. Fog and cloud actually bend around the Mission valley -- locals call it "the donut". Co-working is available, and there are techies and startups around, also the NoiseBridge hacker space, also ten million hipsters. The nightlife is the most vibrant of the entire city. There is no outdoorsy activity whatsoever, except for hipster sports in Dolores Park like lawn bowling or slacklining. Did I mention hipsters? You can pretty much locate yourself anywhere in the Mission; no need to stick close to BART, although in practice commercial spaces tend to be between Valencia and Van Ness.\xc2\xa0Caveat: the East Bay and the Mission have higher crime rates than other areas. You will also encounter non-white people who do not have technology jobs. Remain calm.Third option is SOMA. Weather sucks like the rest of SF. Rents are sky-high, but co-working is possible. Nightlife is kind of meh, but you can BART to more interesting places. No outdoors activity at all. Quantity of techies and startuppers: higher than any place on Planet Earth.Fourth option: peninsula (everything between SF and San Jose). Mountain View is probably the best option for a startup, especially one from NYC. Lots of small and large tech companies around. Google\'s campus is here, Yahoo is next door, Facebook is a couple of Caltrain stops over, but you also have little outfits like Meebo and a hundred others. Lots of restaurants and the place has something that a NYC\'er might dimly recognize as an actually functioning downtown. Outdoors: endless suburbia/tech parks, but you, um, have a view of the nearby mountains. If you locate in downtown Mountain View, you can avoid the usual Silicon Valley trap of having to get into your car whenever you want to take lunch with anyone. It has to be mentioned: if you are from NYC you are going to be really depressed by the peninsula\'s restaurants and nightlife.Side benefit: VC firms and tech giants like Google are located in the peninsula, and travel time to your offices has been known to influence their decisions. If you are very concerned about proximity to investors and acquirers, locating in the East Bay is the worst option.P.S. In general, the Bay Area\'s where-should-I-locate problem is insoluble to a degree that a New Yorker probably cannot appreciate. Every place offers severe tradeoffs.P.P.S. "Commuting into the city for events doesn\'t really bother us." That\'s what you think now, but you will probably find that if you locate in someplace like Mountain View, you simply won\'t have the werewithal to go to SF for events, especially after a day of working on your startup. I worked for an event listings website in the valley and we found we simply couldn\'t make time to actually go to many events.

There are a TON of startups in the area that operate out of their houses. And you are super close to FB, Yahoo, Google, etc...The rent ain't cheap, but being from NYC you're probably used to that, and between the four of you, it's doable. For outdoor activities, there's a lot of biking and hiking pretty close by.

It's a biking city, and there are some amazing hikes around there as well as water sports like kayaking and paddle boarding.

Let me explain:\xc2\xa0In the past several decades San Francisco has let NIMBYism take control of its zoning policy. It has become extremely difficult to build substantial new housing in the city, and over time this has created a housing market that has way fewer units than a city its size and economic prominence should have. This recent zoning map is particularly telling: yellow means that new construction must be four-stories or less \xe2\x80\x94 so even if developers manage to get a project through SF\'s bureaucratic planning labyrinth, it probably won\'t make much of a dent in the housing deficit.This severe shortage of housing means every time there is an economic boom, rents skyrocket, and countless middle- and lower-class people are displaced as the upper class pours in. So yes, these zoning laws do hurt SF\'s residents....with a few exceptions.There are a few SF residents who benefit from these anti-urban zoning laws: The rich and politically-connected NIMBYs who shaped these anti-construction policies in the first place. The Telegraph Hill Dwellers are perhaps the most famous group within this small yet powerful enclave. Any time a new project crops up, they pour huge amounts of money into campaigns to fight it. they operate under the pretense of "protecting the unique and historic character of San Francisco", whereas in reality, they\'re fighting to protect their precious views and artificially over-inflated property values. Time and time again, SF\'s lower classes are swayed by this romantic rhetoric, and instinctively fight all new housing projects in their neighborhood \xe2\x80\x94 and they will still be surprised when the next boom comes and their rents go through the roof. The NIMBY\'s have been able to make a scapegoat of the incoming tech industry, whereas the real blame lies in the hands of those who so vigorously fought new development.

[2] Conflicting studies show that the population could go anywhere from 8.4 million to 9.5 million by 2040 [3]. Given the high cost of building highway infrastructure, as well as limited land space, transportation and city planners are focusing on ways to create more transit-friendly environments that is convenient for living, working, and playing.Given the high cost of living in the City & County of San Francisco, this sort of planning is actually beneficial for San Francisco; given SF\'s limited space, SF\'s neighbors in the East Bay can alleviate some of its housing pain.

In SF in particular, they get hit up by app-makers and startups and vendors more than you\'d think, and they aren\'t likely to want to drop everything and give their attention to something they half-fear already. And many of them already don\'t like techies or apps.I think the best way would be:Choose individuals to contact by looking at restaurants you think your app is good for and then find their owners / managers on social media. You want those folks with at least an FB page or a Twitter account. This both (a) assures they\'re a little savvy and (b) gives you an easy way to contact them.Contact individuals directly to ask for a 15- to 30-minute block of time, or whatever they can spare; meet them where they are, be quick, do not pitch, and listen, listen, listen; ask in your message if there\'s any way you can repay them for their time or help them with anythingLook for forums where restauranteurs hang out and interact, and follow restauranteur blogs; find people active in that scene and see if they\'re willing to check out your app and give feedback, tooCall folks if you can\'t get them on social media or by email.You can of course try to just demo on-the-spot with folks, but we had better success with scheduling meetings and demos ultimately than we did just walking up.

I drive between Mountain View and west San Jose, about 18 miles each way, and the trip is 10-20 minutes shorter with the carpool lane (30-40 minutes total, vs. 40-60 outside the carpool lane).Unfortunately for me, the benefit used to be even greater, but as more and more techies have bought electric cars, the carpool lanes in the south bay have gotten more and more crowded.

Before I got my Tesla I could plan on it taking an hour or more from home to work. With the stickers I'm under half an hour.As I said, your mileage may vary (no pun intended) based on specifically where you are and the proportion of HOV lanes on your route, but I can also tell you that part of this is more than sheer time. The half an hour I save each way pales in comparison to the lack of frustration and stress involved in my commute. You might be able to put a value on time, but it's much harder to put a value on lack of stress. Heck, you might even come to *enjoy* your daily commute and that's almost priceless.The other saving to consider is running costs of your car. Even if you don't think the time and stress savings warrant buying a Tesla, the running costs might. Assuming a 50-mile one way trip (100 mile per day commute), and a car that runs at 20mpg average you'll be paying for 5 gallons of gas - that's $20 at $4/gal - per day.

A good mover will send a representative to your home to see what needs to be moved before they give you a final price estimate. This is done for your protection and it's free. Any mover that tells you otherwise is being shady.I usually suggest that people start with finding agents for the national van lines (United, Mayflower, Atlas, etc.) because you can expect a certain level of consistency in claims procedures, equipments, service, etc. when you work with a national brand. That said, there are a lot of great independent movers out there too - you'll just need to vet them very carefully before hiring them. Check out www.protectyourmove.gov - you can enter in your movers MC and/or DOT numbers to see their record and make sure they are legit. Be wary of online moving brokers and customer review sites (except for www.movingscam.com) - they are often playgrounds for less than honest movers.

That will be checked through your application process. (And you will be surprised how little you get for $2350; it is really depressing.)On a $85k salary, there is a HUGE leeway as to how much you can make available to yourself after the cost of living which includes rent. With roommates, you can bring that down to the sub-$1000 range pretty easily. If you want to have your own place, you can still find something with what you are making.Personally, if you are young, single and make $85k, you should be able to adjust your lifestyle to live very comfortably, even in San Francisco. Depending on how you control rent for yourself, you can choose to save a lot, live lavishly with what remains, or splurge on a "nice" place (which would cost a fraction monthly elsewhere) and live frugally on other parts. I think you will have that choice, at least.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Taro Sato'}, {'answer': "It all depend on your lifestyle, what neighborhood you want to live in and how you eat / spend your time. Many people live in SF on a lot less than $85k. If you live in SOMA or Pac Heights - sure you can spend $3000+ for a 1 bedroom. But you don't have to if that's too expensive. There are plenty of less expensive areas and sometimes landlords don't charge the outrageous high prices. I currently pay $2,700 for a whole house, newly renovated with a garage and a backyard. The difference? My landlords have owned it for 70 years and they're not greedy. They could get $3,500+. Plus I live pretty far from downtown so there's less competition. Likewise you can get a haircut downtown for $100 or you can go to one of the neighborhoods and get a really nice haircut for $20. You can go to the trendy bars and restaurants and pay about double what you'll pay at a nice local place. Your choice - there are options for every budget. You can pay $5 for a cup of hand drip coffee but there's plenty of local places selling normal coffee for $1.65. I saw a made in China jacket going for $400 in Hayes Valley. Nothing special about it. Macy's is a whole lot cheaper. So, all depends on where you go and how you want to live. Want to have a BMW? You better pay for a monthly parking spot. Want to hang out in a trendy place? Be ready to pay double or triple. All in all, I think $85k is a healthy salary to live anywhere. Depends on how you spend your money.

The success of your conversation will depend on how you both react to each other. Use your best judgement--if someone is reading a book or listening to music, or already talking to someone else, they might not want to be bothered.If there's a delay, it's common for people to express their frustration aloud, which sparks a conversation between riders. I've seen groups of fans begin conversations while riding BART to the Oakland Coliseum to watch the Warriors play. If it ever gets awkward, you can always move to a different car.In the context of your question, though, it may be more difficult to start a conversation during commute hours. In the morning, most people are either asleep or trying not to fall when the train moves. In the evening, people are tired.

Petersen'}, {'answer': "It's not that different most other cities in terms of traffic and the ever present possibility of getting run over. If you've bikes in other large cities SF is not really any worse. I got around exclusively by bike in Washington DC for over ten years so I wasn't particularly intimidated by SF traffic. However if you are just learning how to ride a bike, as in the basic mechanics of staying upright, you probably want to spend lots of time in the park just getting used to riding and the 'personality' of your bike. You probably see those courier guys buzzing around with no hands through busy downtown intersections and think you can quickly get to that level of skill--but it takes awhile. First get comfortable enough with riding that you know longer think about it: get the point where riding becomes second nature. When riding in traffic you have to be attentive to dozens of details every second and prepared to act instantaneously--you have to anticipate what drivers might do (often based on watching them for only a few seconds to get a quick feel for their behavior), you check rear view mirrors on parked cars to take note of which are occupied and might 'door' you, you must constantly keep an eye on the road for debris and potholes, all the while timing traffic lights and watching out for pedestrians. Don't get yourself into that situation without becoming a competent rider first.Once you've gotten experienced on your bike and increasingly comfortable in traffic you can slowly do more urban riding. Maybe just stick to areas like the Sunset, the Presidio, Marina, and SOMA at first then work your way up to biking downtown and tackling hills around Telegraph, Potrero, etc, etc. SOMA is nice and flat with wide streets and very little traffic, and you could probably practice safely (just be careful with 101 traffic as it enters/exits the freeway)...but the speeds just aren't very forgiving around there. I would originally just stick to an area with a more suburban feel, where cars go max 20-25mph, and where there is a stop sign on every corner. You will get in accidents, and you will get scraped up--some accidents will be your fault and some won't be. Either way, the difference between a scrape with a bruised ego and quadriplegia/death is largely one of speed and power. Also please invest $25-100 to protect your most important possession: your brain. Wear a helmet. My head has bounced off both windshields and pavement in various accidents and I shudder to think how bad it could've been without one. SF traffic alone isn't really all that bad and moves slowly enough downtown that the real risks are doors and being cut-off by drivers who fail to do a head check (happens all the time, trust me). The taxis in SF are rather dangerous, but the real challenge is the hills. There have been a few where the grade felt quite dangerous riding my brake all the way down. In SF there's always an intersection at the bottom of the hill so you can't simply roll on through. I noticed on my jaunts up to SF (I went to school on the peninsula and lived on a suburban campus) that I would find myself peddling up some brutal hill completely alone, or going down some extremely steep hill, again completely alone. Then I would spend a little time along a flat road and see a fair number of cyclists. And then finally it occurred to me: the cyclists around there have flat routes they all know and use. Only an out-of-towner would push it up some of those hills simply to go from A to B.Friends have mentioned cyclist-friendly maps that illustrate the flatter, bike friendlier routes around the city.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Matthew Sutton'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 2, 4, 17, 39), 'tag': ['San Francisco', 'Bicycles', 'Transportation', 'Cycling', 'Cities and Metro Areas', 'Learning New Things'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

Since they were the only women around for a long time, they ended up marrying a lot of the men who were suddenly rich and becoming the matriarchs of the city\'s most prominent families. Almost every successful family in the city had at least one skeleton in the closet. As a result, the "live and let live" ethos was a foundation of the city\'s mentality. The city continued to attract people who wanted to escape narrow thinking, and so the gay community, the alternative lifestyle movement, and others found a happy home here.

Add to that a critical mass of nearby universities and research institutions (Stanford, Berkeley, UCSF), and you get a idealistic young people from all over the Western US and Asia moving into the area to study. Then add to that the fact that the city was a major embarkation point for the Navy, and that many gay WW2 and post-War sailors with dishonorable discharges for homosexual behavior simply couldn't return to their hometowns, meant that gay men were constantly finding themselves in SF.

San Francisco can\'t hold them all (or even enough to have singular dominance over tech into the 2020s) unless it builds up fast. There just isn\'t room, and the city refuses to build new housing. Two: young people have changed and, as long as a second-tier city is basically educated (Seattle, Boston, and Minneapolis are just as smart as San Francisco and New York) people would rather live there than in a shitty, strip-mall-pocked suburb of a first-tier city.The late 2010s and 2020s will see "nerd diaspora". San Francisco is evolving from a tech hub to a tech finance hub, and while there will be some nerds who stay there-- especially, those who have already achieved success-- most of the prime real estate will go to people who aren\'t nerds. They\'ll be pushed out of San Francisco and (as I discussed) quantum-jump to other cities rather than suburbs. The innovation will be more scattered. San Francisco may be the most innovative major city in 2025, but it won\'t dominate as it did in the 2000s. The gap will shrink. It\'s unclear what the new hubs will be. I used to think I could predict that sort of thing. The truth is: it\'s really hard to tell. I\'ve traveled (within the U.S.) more than almost anyone and you can find talent everywhere: even small towns in Montana. I would guess that there will be five or six of them (anymore spreads the top talent too thin) in major U.S. regions, and probably a few abroad as well. San Francisco is the clear winner in the Southwest region, and Austin will win the South, but which cities will become hubs in other areas is less clear. The Northwest could be won by Seattle or Portland (or both). The Northeast and Midwest are up for grabs.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 22, 'answer_user': 'Michael O.

Find out how they stand with the Better Business Bureau and on review sites such as Yelp and Angie's List. Ask if their movers are trained, background checked, and drug-tested. Be sure to find out if they are licensed movers and if they are apart of any trade organizations such as the local chamber of commerce and the American Moving and Storage Association.

There\'s often a lot of junk food, catered food, and food in general just around. Also startups aren\'t shy about social hours and alcohol consumption so it can be easy to go overboard. I\'ve seen it time and time again in my network.

I am using Craigslist apartment ads to get a quick read on costs. Here are some brief observations:Daly City: Possibly worth looking at if access to SF is very important to you. It\'s a quick trip into the city if you are near the BART line but rentals are less expensive and (I am assuming) a lot less competitive. Not known for having much in the way of culture on its own. Right under the ominous curtain of fog that separates SF from the Peninsula so it is often chilly and damp, and many people don\'t recommend it for that reason alone.Burlingame, San Mateo: Downtown areas were bustling with pedestrians this Saturday afternoon and had a good mix of businesses. On Caltrain line. Depends on your definition of "relatively inexpensive". Redwood City: My dad\'s friend works for the Redwood City planning commission so I have been able to hear about some of their redevelopment work. Once known as Deadwood City and considered kind of sketchy when I was growing up, they are now putting a lot of effort into redevelopment and into expansion of housing stock. This is in sharp contrast to other cities on the Peninsula that resist any new development or densification kicking and screaming. Less expensive by Bay Area standards. Also on the Caltrain line, but far enough south that getting to SF will take a while.I am disqualifying Millbrae and San Bruno (both relatively expensive and right near air traffic from SFO), San Carlos (sleepy and boutiquey feeling, probably not great for a young professional) and Brisbane (not much there, surprisingly inaccessible given proximity to SF)If you are open to living in the East Bay, Oakland qualifies as both underrated and relatively inexpensive, as well as being convenient to SF if you live near BART. Some areas are very nice with walkable business areas and pretty, historic apartments and houses. I have two friends who love the place and would be/are glad to live there.

Like the rivalry with New York, the SF v. LA rivalry is basically one sided. Folks in SF care a lot more about LA, than anyone in LA cares about SF. No one in LA spends one iota of their time thinking, talking, or caring about anyone or anything going on in either NY or SF. In LA, most folks are way too focused on having fun, being their crazy/idiosyncratic selves and living a great life beneath the bountiful sunshine. This "whatever" attitude REALLY grates on New Yorkers and San Franciscans. "How could anyone possibly believe these cities aren\'t the center of all mankind???" The nerve of those infidels!! In almost 10 years of living in LA, Ive never had one single conversation with anyone (other than some complaining New York expat) about how either SF or NY sucks. I expect if I brought up how much SF sucks as a topic here in LA, people would say "We are talking about this why???"This attitude belies a basic extreme geo-centricity of San Franciscans which at the core believes you are not a serious or successful person if you are not "grinding it out daily" in some horrible, cloudy, cold concrete jungle with a huge monthly rent for a crappy apartment. I know, living on the east coast for most of my life, I was dismissive of LA. Then, I started to spend time in LA. A few days led to a few weeks, weeks led to months and soon I started to realize: "WTF am I doing???" What is so great about suffering through east coast winters, dealing with over bearing high achievers, and a rigid social structure?\xc2\xa0 So, I finally learned, if you can\'t beat them, then join them. I quickly learned that you don\'t need to live in one geographical area to be a serious, successful professional.\xc2\xa0 Life is too short for weather to be any part of your daily decision process. Sure, LA has tons of urban problems: traffic, crime, etc, but its not like NY or SF don\'t have these problems too, but these people tend to forget their city\'s own problems. In SF for instance, even if you are staying at a 4 star hotel, you are constantly besieged by the homeless. What is that?\xc2\xa0 Try renting an apartment in SF or NY! Major project. Anyway, the fact is, here in LA, yes we have problems, but we choose to deal or not deal with them in the pleasant sunlight the way humans should live. In short, the dislike of LA is a muted form of jealously. San Franciscans, like New Yorkers, believe that if they have to suffer to be successful, then everyone else should too. In LA, we dont agree.

There is no plastic surgery and relatively little emphasis on fashion, makeup, etc. This is great for raising kids, because all that focus on personal appearance is socially and psychologically unhealthy.

You literally cannot drive one block without passing several luxury vehicles and multi-million dollar homes. George Packer, who grew up in Silicon Valley and attended local Gunn High, described it as such in his recent New Yorker piece, Change the World:...the average house in Palo Alto sells for more than two million dollars. The Stanford Shopping Center\xe2\x80\x99s parking lot is a sea of Lexuses and Audis, and their owners are shopping at Burberry and Louis Vuitton. There are fifty or so billionaires and tens of thousands of millionaires in Silicon Valley; last year\xe2\x80\x99s Facebook public stock offering alone created half a dozen more of the former and more than a thousand of the latter. There are also record numbers of poor people, and the past two years have seen a twenty-per-cent rise in homelessness, largely because of the soaring cost of housing. After decades in which the country has become less and less equal, Silicon Valley is one of the most unequal places in America.Now, most of the Louis Vuitton-toting people I know are very friendly. But down-to-earth and non-materialistic are the last words I would use to describe the overwhelming majority of people in this neck of the woods. To that end, I also disagree that this is a diverse place. The diversity here is whether you are Asian, Indian or White, and whether your parents work for Google, Facebook or Stanford (or Quora!). Racial diversity is not the same as socioeconomic diversity, and as Packer alluded to, this is easily one of the most unequal places in America (that East Palo Alto, which was a few years ago one of the most crime-ridden places in the United States, can exist just blocks from the American Versailles that is Stanford continues to boggle my mind). Personally, I would have to think long and hard before raising kids here. Schools are great and the people are friendly, but I also think the majority of people here lack an awareness about struggles that the average person faces (one of my former professors once commented, "If you went to Stanford and then lived in Silicon Valley, you could go the rest of your life without ever stepping foot in the real world.") This is even reflected in philanthropic giving:\xc2\xa0 The good people of Compton give a significantly higher percentage of discretionary income to charity than do those of Atherton, despite the latter having 23x as much money available. I don\'t think it\'s because those who live in Atherton don\'t care (and there are of course many exceptions to this -- people who have a lot and do give a lot); I think it is because they aren\'t surrounded on a daily basis by people who need their help, and thus lack an awareness of the issues to which they could contribute a solution. Intellectually, this is a great place to be. There are many, many good reasons to be here. But there is a high level of entitlement and materialism that would cause me a great deal of concern if I were a parent.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 137, 'answer_user': 'Torey McMurdo'}, {'answer': 'Unless you are already wealthy, raising children in Silicon Valley requires more sacrifices and trade-offs than in almost any other area of the US. This is mostly due to the insanely high cost of housing in all areas of the Peninsula. In any area of the Peninsula with a "good" school district the cost is doubly insane.Jobs with the local tech companies tend to require that you pour most of your time and energy into them, and the rewards are commensurately high. However, competition for resources (houses, private school, daycare, summer camp, etc) ends up driving up the prices of these things so that the relatively high compensation compared to the national averages doesn\'t yield a comparably high standard of living. Even households making $200K+ a year feel like they are barely making it if they want to own a detached single family home in an area with good public schools.Almost all families with kids have 2 parents working full time because both incomes are needed to make ends meet, mostly due to high housing costs. If you have a family where both parents have this type of career, they will have less time to spend with the kids than in other situations. When thinking about whether a place is good for raising children, I think the amount of time parents can spend with their children is perhaps the most important factor, and SV rates low on this metric.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 54, 'answer_user': 'Nathan Schrenk'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 28, 5, 54), 'tag': ['Silicon Valley', 'California', 'San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Francisco', 'Parenting'], 'question_user': 'Alan Morrison'}

{'qid': 600, 'ans_num': 11, 'question': '\xc3\xa2\xc2\x98\xc2\x85How can San Francisco solve its homelessness problem without simply kicking all of them out of the City?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'Thanks for asking me to answer this question. My answer may come from a different perspective than anticipated, but I hope it\'s helpful nonetheless. Other than scale, there is little unique about New York\'s or San Francisco\'s homeless problems. Homelessness anywhere can be largely solved, but not without solving some other crises at the same time. There are many, including some who have already answered here, who offer well thought out strategies for solving this problem. Sadly, in the current circumstance they can accomplish no more than the last thousand committees, even if they are the smartest, most educated, most dedicated people to ever walk the planet. Here\'s why. Great solutions, based on evidence and careful analysis, are of little value until they are sincerely implemented by lawmakers. Any "solution" that purports to solve the problem without addressing the underlying causes can have only a limited and temporary impact. The major drivers of homelessness (and poverty in general) in America are well documented. They fall into four areas, as I see them: Education - It just plain sucks for most poor people, and a lousy education is a lifelong handicap. Healthcare - The poorest need it most, and when they don\'t have it, the rest of us pay for it anyhow.The "War on Drugs" - Whether you study its history or its effects today, this is truly just a war on minorities. It\'s cost us over a trillion bucks over the last 40 years, it\'s provided no benefit to the public at large, and it severely limits the economic output of those it targets. Other Public Policies - Admittedly a catch-all. Specifically, I mean policies that continue to stratify the gap in income and opportunity (In addition to the three above, the inequitable tax code, cuts to a variety of benefits, administering benefits in such a way that they dis-incent productivity, selectively stigmatizing income/sexuality/gender/religion, etc.).Politically, some of these are held hostage by the right, others by the left. In terms of the first three areas, the poor are a major profit center for Corporate America, and therefore are major profit centers for lobbying and politics on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 Unions continue to stand in the way of education reforms that have proven highly effective. To a significant extent, all of the drivers are products of a "fear economy" - that is, the bloc of voters/consumers who feel financially squeezed, and are being told by certain religious and political factions that the burden of supporting the poor is to blame. These Americans are by no means stupid, but they are frequently misinformed by sources who purport to provide objective information. The messaging that surrounds these four drivers is where the real opportunity lies.\xc2\xa0 Sociologists and economists know a lot about what policies result in changed circumstances and behavior, but too many voters and legislators subscribe to ideologies ("common sense") with which the facts disagree.\xc2\xa0 If we can educate our citizens to how changes in these four areas would help - if we can shift the conversation to be about facts rather than fear - then we can make some progress.\xc2\xa0 The public at large (even Corporate America) hugely benefits long term if we fix these four drivers - but we need to show them how, rather than spend all our energy on partisan sniping and grandstanding. There\'s another element that changes for the better as the conversation becomes civilized. Replacing more of the fear with a rational understanding of why things are the way they are begins to tear down some of the adversarial barriers between camps. Committees are more likely to find great solutions, legislators are more likely to adopt them, and individuals are more likely to personally offer help to those who need some. Cooperation is the key. Personally, I\'m learning to listen better to those I disagree with and respond in a more helpful way.\xc2\xa0 I\'m watching as some people achieve significant progress - and they aren\'t always people I agree with. To all who work and advocate on behalf of those who need help, thank you. To sum up, I believe we need to focus better on the root causes of poverty and homelessness, rather than band-aids that make for good photo ops. Let\'s educate people about what the causes are and what we can/should do to change them. Let\'s cooperate and facilitate creative solutions, even from contrarian sources. Let\'s do more of what works, regardless of politics. Finally, let\'s stop tolerating the hype and hyperbole that passes for news/debate/information in this country.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 27, 'answer_user': 'Ben Robbins'}, {'answer': 'First: I agree with Sandro Pasquali who correctly points out that New York City has not "solved" the homelessness "problem," [1] and [4] - so I don\'t agree with the underlying premise. [Update: I also don\'t agree that NYC made "significant" progress since much of what they have done includes shipping homeless to other states - and in some cases - exotic locales - with one-way tickets.]Second: The larger issue is that poverty is often the result of mental illness (behavioral health) and that\'s a much larger societal and national issue. All major metropolitan areas are more susceptible to homelessness because it\'s far easier to survive a subsistence living in cities than rural areas. Third: Poverty itself is at record levels. A Census Bureau study last year showed that there are now 100 million Americans (basically 1/3 of the country) living below, at - or within 50% of the Federal Poverty Level. [2]Many cities have attempted to "off-load" their homeless in a variety of ways - including:One-way bus tickets [3]One-way air line tickets (looking at you NYC) often to exotic locales (Paris, Johannesburg, or San Juan) [4]Prison - probably the most commonThe cop on the street will tell you - we dump them at the jail.A study by the Washington-based Treatment Advocacy Center released last year found there are three times more mentally ill people in U.S. jails than in hospitals, and that 15 to 20 percent of inmates in American jails suffer from a mental illness. [5]Also, a disproportionately large number of homeless are Vets - who suffer many complications associated with the prosecution of war - PTSD and drug abuse being the most prevalent. There are about 67,000 homeless veterans in the United States today, and according to Mark Johnston, the acting assistant secretary for community planning and development at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, at least a third are chronically homeless. [6] There are, however, signs of some improvement ahead - most notably with the national movement of communities called: 100,000 Homes - http://www.100khomes.org\xc2\xa0 This group is working collaboratively - across many different agencies - to make it easier to triage and then place those that are displaced into a variety of facilities - often with ones that include behavioral healthcare.The larger issue - behavioral healthcare - remains. A law was passed in 1986 (Mental Health Parity Act) that was effectively circumvented by most insurance plans until the passage in 2008 (via TARP) of the Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) - which is scheduled to be "phased in" over several years - and still has ambiguity around specific coverage for PTSD and eating disorders. For many - if not most - basic healthcare insurance coverage has not (historically) included behavioral healthcare [7] This is also true for dental and vision coverage - which is often a fraction of real cost - if included at all. You may get free dental check-ups - but that crown will likely be a 50% out-of-pocket expense.Behavioral healthcare (and it\'s inclusion as part of basic healthcare insurance coverage) is a subset of our National Healthcare Expenditure (NHE). Our NHE is now at $3 trillion per year - which represents about 18% of our GDP and is growing at the rate of about 5% per year. The fact that we can have the most expensive healthcare system on the planet - that often doesn\'t include behavioral healthcare (or full dental and vision) is further evidence of how our NHE has become a global embarrassment and national emergency.

So does insurmountable debt especially when it\'s the IRS\' unavoidable payment of debt. I met a few in the homeless shelters that came from real middle class incomes and simply couldn\'t get out of the hole without a large income. Try earning $3K a month and having an IRS levy taking $2700 a month from you. You can\'t make a car payment, you lose your car, you can\'t get to work you lose your job. You sell every thing you own until you can\'t pay your rent, you\'re in a homeless shelter. There isn\'t a lot you can do on $300 a month. All of the sudden - You\'re receiving General Assistance and Food Stamps and if you find a new job you\'re going to have a window of about 2 months before the IRS finds your income and levy\'s it. Your boss isn\'t going to like you very much because he/she now has to do extra accounting and is basically getting punished for hiring you because you\'re a scab if he can fire you, he will. Never mind that it\'s nearly impossible to get that job when you\'re living out of a draw in your 90 day bed. So if you find a job it\'s going to be minimum wage and your debt is enormous. Maybe you were low income and you had no healthcare because you didn\'t know they even had Healthy San Francisco until after you were in so much pain that you couldn\'t work anymore. Now you have permanent nerve damage, you\'re in a wheel chair, you\'ve become mentally ill because enough stress can make anyone crazy. You\'re panicked and you can\'t get a job because you\'re so desperate you freak out anyone who does respond to your mentally charged cover letter and resume in the interviews. You can\'t do a lot of basic jobs because you\'re handicapped and the processes involved in being trained for a new career are so bureaucratic it\'s crazier than you are. Quite a few of these people do drugs and have a tendency to abuse alcohol from the top to the bottom. I\'d guesstimate that the number of people in the shelter system (the bottom two groups and the mentally challenged that live in shelters) who are redeemable is around 30%. Most would smoke mild enough drugs and drink within the limits of a normal person if they had peace of mind. All they need is a runway.

Some of my best date spots with my girlfriend are casual and perhaps overly well lit spots but which hold a lot of personal import to us (Cha-ya which serves vegan Japanese temple food, Vik\'s Chaat House in Berkeley)2) For a special date a place which takes some effort/dedication on your part is always a nice thing - Flour+Water is an amazing option here - hard to get a reservation but if you really care you can get there before they open, wait in line and get a walk-in spot for you and your date. Well worth the effort as the food is fantastic (and personally meaningful for me as a fantastic second date there led to a third and now ongoing relationship...)3) Pick a restaurant that matches what you as a couple most enjoy. My girlfriend is vegetarian so though I love Incanto (and indeed we did go there on a date as a treat for me on my birthday) it isn\'t the best of picks for us as a couple as the chef\'s focus is very much on meat. I\'m not a huge drinker - so while we love Heaven\'s Dog for the food and my girlfriend loves their mixed drinks the deep skill of their mixologist bartenders is lost on me. As is any restaurant with a deep wine list (as I\'ll rarely have more than a single glass or a few small tasting glasses in a given month let alone at a single meal) But we both love great, creative, local, seasonal food - which thankfully leaves dozens of fantastic date options here in SF.So my answer would vary greatly by the interests of the given couple.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Shannon John Clark'}, {'answer': 'Chez Papa Bistrot - This is the Potrero Hill sister to Chez Papa Resto in SOMA; charming, intimate bistro setting, more classic French menu than Resto.Bar Tartine - Beautiful bistro space, dark wood and marble; food is more New American inspired by France.Cotogna - Warm space, a little more earthy than the others; excellent Italian food, more relaxed than its sister Quince next door.Commonwealth - The interior has clean lines, but still feels warm; absolutely beautiful food, vibrant natural composition of the plate without being too fussy; thoughtful wine list that provides a great breadth of choices without turning into an epic novel.La Mar Cebicheria  - Very upbeat scene, modern space; Peruvian cuisine, nice ceviche and seafoodEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Michael Molesky'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2010, 11, 28, 0, 24), 'tag': ['Food in San Francisco', 'San Francisco', 'Dating Advice'], 'question_user': 'Michael Kim'}

{'qid': 609, 'ans_num': 20, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why are some San Francisco residents angry with technology companies and their workers?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'As a techie who has been living here since Bubble 1.0, let me take a swing at it. First, a graph:This is housing prices in the San Francisco MSA, a 5-county area, as measured by the Case-Shiller Index. It\'s scaled so that Nov 1993 = 1, as that\'s when the Mosaic browser was introduced. Look at it for a bit. When the dot-com bubble got going, area housing prices jumped substantially. By the peak of the housing bubble, they were more than 3x what they were a decade before. With the latest tech boom (or is it another tech bubble?) house prices are skyrocketing again, up 25% in the last year. And that\'s for a 5-county area; my impression is that San Francisco itself is substantially worse.With that as background, let me start withItem 1: We\'re driving the prices up.The Internet is making a lot of money. That money comes from all over, but a lot of it gets spent here. That\'s pushing prices up. Some residential landlords report raising rents by 40% in a year. Commercial rents are soaring as well as companies jostle for more office space. When space costs more, so does everything else. Tech salaries are keeping up, but that\'s not true for everybody else.Item 2: We\'re changing the character of the city.For decades, San Francisco was a haven for all sorts of people: immigrants, beatniks, hippies, artists. It had a rich history of creativity going back at least to Emperor Norton. Many of those people have been driven out by the rising prices. Some to the East Bay, some much further afield. I like tech people just fine, but even I find the suddenness of the shift discomfiting. I sometimes think that it would be nice to go to a cafe and see people doing something, anything other than tech. Imagine how it feels to people not in the industry.Item 3: We\'re gentrifying many neighborhoods.The departures aren\'t equally distributed across all classes: the arrival of rich techies is forcing out poor non-techies. Inequality is up substantially; our Gini coefficient has gone from 0.36 in 1990 to 0.51 in 2009, versus 0.43 to 0.47 over the same period. That means that San Francisco used to be substantially more equal than the US, and now it\'s substantially less so. The Mission is a great example of the gentrification; you only have to look at the rash of new, expensive restaurants along Valencia Street to see how quickly it\'s changing.Item 4: We\'re shifting the racial mix.Black population in SF is down from 11% in 1990 to 6% in 2010. Latino population in the Mission is down 22% from 2000 to 2010. Recent arrivals may not notice, but I promise you that plenty of other people do:Item 5: Tech is fashionable and powerful.Just today the Washington Post wrote an article about ThinkGeek and its journey from niche site to mainstream pop culture vendor while selling basically the same stuff. How? Geek culture has become mainstream. In the 1980s nerds needed revenge; today, we run the world. A lot of people would like a tax break for $55 million, but it\'s only Twitter that recently got one. If a regular person stops in a bus zone, they get a ticket. But rich Valley tech companies run an entire fleet of fancy private buses, further driving up prices in the city, and nobody says boo. That\'s power.Item 6: We\'re privileged, which often makes us oblivious.If you aren\'t familiar with the technical term "privilege", start with John Scalzi\'s excellent essay: "Straight White Male: The Lowest Difficulty Setting There Is". The average technology worker is a young, articulate, educated, straight, white male with a fat salary and a promising future. We are not exactly experiencing a ton of adversity. That makes it easy to be clueless about how easy our lives are, and some, like Greg Gopman and Peter Shih amplify that into being total assholes.Summary: I think their anger is reasonable.Note that I\'m not saying there\'s anything wrong with my fellow technology company workers. But I get the point of long-time residents. They didn\'t ask to have their rents driven through the roof. They didn\'t ask for a lot of fancy restaurants that they never go to. They certainly didn\'t ask for large companies in the South Bay to bus in thousands of young millionaires and soon-to-be millionaires. To them it feels like an invasion. And it\'s not just locals; even many tech industry people think it has gone too far (see, e.g., "Douchebags Like You Are Ruining San Francisco" or "The Year We Broke Everything").Is this uncomfortable? Yes. But I think everybody in the tech industry has to accept that "just living our lives" is screwing up other people\'s lives. I don\'t know how to solve that problem, but I think the first step is accepting that there is a problem, and that we are the proximate cause of it. However swell we are as individuals, our arrival is creating a lot of negative externalities, and I think we should own that.[Note: The phrase "just living our lives" is from the original question details; it has since been edited.]Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 438, 'answer_user': 'William Pietri'}, {'answer': '(An adaptation of a digest post that I\'m in the process of paring down, so you\'ll get the long form)The short is I believe that Las Vegas (and now increasingly San Francisco, as the dominant startup and tech community nationally) represent a leading edge of what will be a national issue as startup hubs grow around the country and the need for geographic concentration decreases with improved communications technology.My takeaway: We are bad at integrating into existing communities and will need to struggle to build connections with other social circles and subcultures to avoid a growing backlash. I agree with William Pietri in thinking the anger is reasonable.---------------------From recent NY Times articles about tech-driven wealth disparity in SF to that founder rant about the city, this issue is not a set of weekly data points but rather something that is building up over months and years. We\'ll try and piece out what\'s going on, how startups can best protect themselvesGreg Gopman\xe2\x80\x94Greg Gopman\'s rant about the long-present, low-income homeless and otherwise transient population of the Mid-Market area in San Francisco (which has seen a tech and startup explosion after the Twitter tax deal) set off a firestorm of press coverage.The rant and ensuing press coverage extended a narrative from throughout 2013 [ed: read this one as a summary] about an insular and arrogant tech community\xe2\x80\x94with bigtech and startups being lumped together\xe2\x80\x94displacing and dismissing existing communities. Such a narrative brings significant political costs to new startups and established tech companies both.As Josh Ellis of the below-linked Las Vegas piece writes, "my version of community-building isn\'t running off everybody you don\'t like and replacing them with people you do like, or can profit off of." At this point in time, too many public commentators see the growth of tech as driving off anyone who makes us uncomfortable. Further, most in tech and startups effectively wall themselves off, from the Google, Apple, and other bigtech private bus lines to social circles including few outside of the tech or startup communities. So when we defend ourselves, we\'re primarily talking only to ourselves, which isn\'t particularly effective.SF Google Bus protest\xe2\x80\x94Following the line from Marx that history repeats itself, once as tragedy, once as farce, the aforementioned Google private bus line was also targeted by a protest, which featured an individual masquerading as a Google employee ranting back at the protest in Gopmanesque language.Protesters feel that tech is driving rising inequality in SF and not contributing to account for the public resources (e.g. road upkeep) they consume, as well as skyrocketing housing prices among a city population that is two-thirds renters. Interestingly, according to tech and startup community survey, TechAdvocacy.us, we also feel that rising inequality is a serious issue, but again, we are poorly positioned to let other groups know that we agree with them.Lsa Vegas Tech\xe2\x80\x94This discussion is not limited to SF\xe2\x80\x94Las Vegas has been going through a similar debate with the much more centrally-planned Downtown Project (DTP), which is a visionary effort led by Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh to revitalize downtown Las Vegas through promoting both tech and non-tech entrepreneurial activities. As startups hubs continue to take root across the nation, our difficulty in integrating and community building must be something we address rather than continue to avoid.Startups on the Outside\xe2\x80\x94Politics is often about identity, and despite awesome groups, such as Latino Startup Alliance, Women 2.0, or Black Founders, startups and tech are seen as the domain of white, hetero, young, upper-middle class males, for better or worse. This has caused backlash before\xe2\x80\x94most recently, over Twitter\xe2\x80\x94and our internal conversations tend to quickly devolve into infighting, especially anecdote driven over data\xe2\x80\x94the opposite of how we run our companies!Campaigns on the Left have their first lesson for new organizers be about telling your (personal) story, making a connection with the person you\'re talking to. Our personal stories often have little in common with a homeless man, a working-class maid, living paycheck to paycheck, or anyone who\'s ever used a pawn shop or payday loan (shark). As Eric Ries so nicely put it, "it is extremely easy for systems to become biased, even if none of the individual people in those systems intends to be biased." We need to understand how it is perceived that so many of our faces are white and male, when talent comes from all corners of the American (and world) population.And we desperately need to avoid the Wall Street outcome of being hated and targeted by large swathes of the political landscape. At the least, it increases the costs of startups expanding operations to new cities through having to spend larger amounts of time explaining benefits to local elected officials; at the most, we could see federal-level regulation that seeks to protect consumers and residents.Moving forward, I advocate for forgiveness towards Greg, who did apologize\xe2\x80\x94under duress or not from the growing media firestorm. But as a community, we need to look inward and talk outside our existing circles to learn how to better relate to the larger communities where we live and work, while showing compassion towards all.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 23, 'answer_user': 'Craig Montuori'}, {'answer': 'The main points about housing, privilege, gentrification have already been made. But those are merely matters of economics, and we shouldn\'t fault techies for wanting to work in a moneyed and booming industry. In my opinion the real reason is the focus of this New York Times article: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/1...Basically, tech companies encourage a isolationist, navel-gazing culture, which has negative physical repercussions on the urban landscape.To encourage their employees to work longer and longer hours, companies try to provide everything they could want inside the office \xe2\x80\x94 so they don\'t have to wander to (and participate in) the city outside. Many techies are fed breakfast, lunch and dinner, and have luxurious amenities and recreation to use whenever they feel. The bigger tech companies (e.g. Twitter) buy up massive buildings in prime locations, then turn them inward, away from the city and the public, into a walled garden to keep their employees happy and comfortably segregated from the commoners outside. Tech employees employed in the city can easily spend an entire workday without ever interacting with other San Franciscans \xe2\x80\x94 private bus ride straight to the office, lunch break in the office, coffee break in the office, dinner and drinks in the office, and then private bus ride home. From the NYT article: Twitter\'s headquarters, prime real estate in the middle of downtown SF. A literal fortress of a building, completely turned away from the outside world.It\'s that inward-facing isolationist culture that makes it so easy for the rest of us to see tech workers as the invading "other", using their riches to swoop up pieces of the city out of the public grasp. The greatest cities are great because of the chaotic diversity they provide, the random interactions, the cramming of different types of people & businesses into a small area. But many tech companies are awkwardly forcing their compartmentalized suburban culture into a diverse and chaotic urban setting \xe2\x80\x94 they want to be located in the city, but don\'t really want to participate in it.

This understandably upsets a lot of people who face serious financial strains and see the foundations of their lives threatened.In times like these people want someone to blame, and newly arriving groups of people with strange habits and different attitudes will always be good candidates.Human nature on the default setting is that when someone of your group acts badly, you think "Wow, that guy is such a jerk!", but when someone from the outsider group does the same you think "Wow, those techies are such jerks!".That said, sometimes the people you want to blame actually are the problem. And of course the rising prices are related to the influx of tech workers and money.But to me the core problem is San Francisco\'s refusal to build any substantial amount of new housing. A well functioning city in in boom times would be crawling with construction, expansion and improvements as it adapts and grows. But SF has chosen to remain largely unchanged since many decades, and we see the effects now. If the city won\'t adapt, it\'s people has to do so, perhaps by moving to Walnut Creek to make room.Again, let\'s consider human nature.

San Francisco, a city of immigrants, has always had some ambivalence over those moving in, whether it was the Chinese or Catholic Europeans in the 1800s, Okies in the 30s, the flower children of the 1960s, and so on. That goes on all over the world, only with different problems and different scapegoats. The media, which is largely young, low paid, and illiterate in the ways of business and technology, is fomenting this by promoting nonsense scandals or fake issues like the so-called "Twitter tax break" that they don\'t care to actually explain. A homeless person gets insulted by a store clerk and it\'s another day in the Tenderloin. A homeless guy gets insulted by a tech worker and it\'s front page news for a few days.There are real changes afoot in San Francisco, and plenty of unsolved problems.

Of course those in the hipster tribe are similar to one another in some respects, but without some common context there couldn\'t be a subculture. Subcultures are built around similarities, and though it\'s funny sometimes that people who are all "different" are the same as one another it\'s actually comforting to the "different" people to know there are others like them, and to have someone to share their experience with. You could make the same sorts of arguments about punks, mods, goths, b-boys, longhairs, hippies, or any other modern clique/subculture.

What\'s irritating about them is this ostentatious, supercilious, I\'m so cool that I\'m too cool for anything that anyone else likes. I have to be into obscure things. Falsely in what I see. And then, anyone who isn\'t a hipster just doesn\'t get it. They are into things simply because no one else is. Not because of passion or interest, just to be aberrant, no matter how. They have this superiority complex where you feel like this constant air of condescension around them because you\'re too "pop".How? Cause I listen to bands other people have heard of? I don\'t feel like everyone else is below me because they aren\'t as cultured or I don\'t know what the hell they\'re aiming to be but "different for the sole sake of being different". That\'s the cool qualifier.The more esoteric their interests, the more self assured they are that they\'re on the bleeding edge of some special elitist wave that everyone else will catch years from now.It\'s all in the attitude. Which I feel is negative, condescending and "too cool to exist". You can say I\'m doing that now, but I was always the kid in school who rotated around the subculture groups because I liked them all in their own respect. I don\'t normally dislike people. That\'s very rare for me. Yet these people get under my skin.As said. I\'m speaking about the ones I\'m seeing around my city. I don\'t know if it apples all over. This is a perception developed from first hand experience.And I love as said in the other post. They want so desperately to fit in with the other hipsters while simultaneously rejecting the fact that they want to be affiliated with any group. So they all end up hating each other, even cause they can\'t lose their pride and sense of being too cool of a cat to conform to anything, even the group that they\'re emulating and aim to be like!It\'s loss of identity. It\'s trend. And they\'re more anti- than the punk scene ever was. Punk just had anti- (insert something meaningful). Hipster is just like anti- (insert anything that anyone else is doing or liking).The full deal is it\'s just irritating and I like harmony in subculture, not dissonance and tension. That defeats the purpose of trying to get in with those you align with most.If you don\'t even have your own identity, how are you going to find others to identify with? It\'s dissonance culture. Other subs stick together and appreciate each other. A brother/sisterhood. This is just another creature. One I\'m just not feeling.And I saw a comment about "real hipsters"\xe2\x80\x94 well, everyone claims to be the real thing but I get you. There\'s been posers and impostors since society began.

I moved from The Mission to Temescal around 2003. My family and I really love Oakland; I now live in El Cerrito for personal reasons, but we spend a lot more time going back to visit Oakland than visiting SF. Oakland is a really wonderful, special place to live and my wife, a long-time SF resident, was initially hesitant, but quickly came to really love it as well.Oakland has far greater diversity in terms of neighborhoods, in terms of people and\xc2\xa0 in terms of housing stock. WRT housing stock, there\'s a large range in cost, from Piedmont, which has the best schools in the Bay Area and beautiful multi-million dollar homes (and you actually get a yard and a huge home to go with that pricetag instead of a tiny plot and *a few thousand* square feet), to the poorer parts of Oakland, which I assume you won\'t be targeting (correct if wrong). In between you have bohemian West Oakland, "mid-class" Temescal, with up and coming restaurants and lots of young families, "upper-middle-class" Rockridge, which is more established, to Montclair, where you can have a beautiful house on the hill, to name a few. Given a certain amount of money (rent or buy) you will have a lot more options to chose from. WRT to people, when you go out, you will see a population diversity that SF can only hope for - lots of different races, socioeconomic classes, etc - actually intermingling. It\'s no coincidence that one of the strongest, most vibrant Occupy movement was in Oakland. Oakland has a vibrant blue-collar legacy to match its burgeoning tech/art populations.We don\'t go back to SF very much - there are plenty of great restaurants in Oakland: it was recently featured in NYTimes "36 hours in..." series and was also awarded its first Michelin star. You are also close to Berkeley\'s gourmet ghetto, though the burgeoning Telegraph/Temescal restaurant scene I\'d say is unrivaled in terms of young, new, exciting chefs.There\'s also plenty to do: lots of great music in downtown at places like the Fox Theater and Paramount Theater, event/happenings, like Art Murmur (Oakland Art Murmur - First Friday / Saturday Stroll Art Walks), the pop-up carnival, Peralta Junction (http://peraltajunction.com/) and more family oriented events like Bites off Broadway (http://www.bitesoffbroadway.com/) and great non-hectic farmers\' markets (http://www.yelp.com/biz/temescal...). There are also great bars, though they are a bit more spread out than they are in places like the Mission. So, you sort of need to pick a place and stay, instead of hopping across 6 places. Shopping/people watching is pretty good, too, on Piedmont Ave and College Ave/Rockridge and around Lake Merritt.We do come back to SF but mainly for nostalgia - we usually go to Dolores Park, Tartine and Bi-Rite - and for baseball games - Pacbell is one of the best in America, o.Co one of the worst. Occasionally, we\'ll endeavor to try a new restaurant in the city, too - maybe 3-4 times a year, if that.What I don\'t miss is the claustrophobic hipster/tech culture of SF.Work-wise, commuting may be more difficult and that should be a factor in any decision you make. The number of hours a day you spend on BART or in a car will probably be a bigger factor in your happiness than the quality of the local dive bars. I do think age is an important factor here.While there are tons of young artists in Oakland, I would recommend that everyone live in the heart of some big city - NYC, Chi, DC, LA, SF - for a chunk of time in their early-mid 20s. Once you are less enamored of being literally at the heart of everything, Oakland is a great choice that I don\'t think you\'d regret.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 22, 'answer_user': 'Marc Ettlinger'}, {'answer': 'My wife and I moved to Oakland in October 2012.\xc2\xa0 We started looking for houses in the east bay after our landlord in SF (soma around 11th and folsom) raised our rent to $2650 for the loft we had been in for 3 years.\xc2\xa0 We ended up (after 7 months and 5 failed offers) getting a house in North Oakland near the berkeley, emeryville, and oakland borders. We were able to get a house that costs roughly the same monthly as the new rent in the city cost, but we get another bedroom and a nice warm yard to go with it.Pros:- We live in an area with "real people". I work in the startup world and am surrounded by young, privileged, upper middle class, white men (of which I am one!) all day long. It\'s nice to be around people that aren\'t in the tech world and don\'t all have the same basic background.- The weather is just better.\xc2\xa0 It\'s 5-10 degrees warmer every day and sunny much more often and for longer.\xc2\xa0 On a typical day I leave my job near Civic Center in SF just after the fog has blown in and get home to a bright sunny yard.- You can find parking anywhere (usually).\xc2\xa0 Totally unlike SF where you have to hunt for a parking spot forever, on pretty much any street in oakland you can find a place to park.\xc2\xa0 Even when there are big events happening you only have to go a block or two out of the way to find an open spot.- Our yard.\xc2\xa0 We *love* our yard.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve lived in a condo or apartment since 2002 and having a yard is fantastic. There are definitely yards to be had in SF, but the weather is more iffy.- There are a ton of things going on in Oakland.\xc2\xa0 We are still finding our way around, but there is no lack of things to do at all.- We ride folding bikes to BART and take the train into the city for work which takes 35-40 minutes each way and we have the option of catching a bus a block from our house that goes straight to the transbay terminal. It\'s longer than our old commute, but really easy and it\'s nice to be outside a bit before/after work when we bike to BART.Cons:- We drive too much. There is pretty good public transportation around us that we use, but it\'s just so darn easy to pull the car out of the driveway instead.- Commute cost has gone up a bit. We pay almost $7 a day each to get to work on BART instead of the $4 total we spent when we lived in the city, but it\'s better than $5 toll, $25 to park, and gas.- Crime seems to be around a lot more. In SF I knew that there was crime happening, but it never felt very personal for some reason.\xc2\xa0 Now in Oakland I\'m much more tuned in (probably because of a product called NextDoor), and I know that there have been a lot of burglaries in and around my neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 I also know someone who\'s brother-in-law was abducted and assaulted and burglarized.\xc2\xa0 There was a murder a couple blocks from my house earlier in the summer.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t personally felt unsafe, but I do fear that my house may be targeted at some point.Anyway, my wife and I love the choice we made.\xc2\xa0 Oakland is really great and hopefully only going to get better.\xc2\xa0 There are problems like every city, but there is a ton to do, a lot of the city is beautiful, the weather is great, the diversity is really nice, etc.\xc2\xa0 I\'d definitely make the move again!Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 25, 'answer_user': 'Michael Abner'}, {'answer': "Like most average income couples (we both make $70K plus), we got priced out of SF when we went to buy a house.\xc2\xa0 We might have been able to afford a tiny condo, but we have a dog and wanted a yard and more space for less than $3K a month so SF was out.\xc2\xa0 We looked at Pacifica, which is an underrated little town just south of SF, but everything in our price range was a fixer-upper in the extreme sense of the term.We had heard all of the same crime stories as everyone else but the garage at our place in SF was broken into and people were robbed at gunpoint in our old neighborhood too.\xc2\xa0 It's the price of living in a city, unfortunately.\xc2\xa0 Oakland is short about 200 cops for the population size but we feel like we can try to be part of fixing the problem through neighborhood groups and using our vote wisely.\xc2\xa0 It's not going to change overnight but there are just as many sketchy neighborhoods in SF as there are in Oakland, let's be honest.\xc2\xa0 I saw police rope off crime scenes with dead bodies twice - once in the Mission and once right next door to Great American Music Hall in my brief time living there (5-1/2 years).\xc2\xa0 Oakland has turned out to be not just our next-best option but the best in many ways:1.\xc2\xa0 Oakland airport is close and easy to get to, but just cross 92 and you can get to SFO fairly quickly.\xc2\xa0 San Jose airport isn't far either if you have to travel for work.2.\xc2\xa0 It is so much WARMER!\xc2\xa0 You get a summer in the summertime -

when they're not striking, the trains are cleaner than the buses, people are more polite overall, they actually line up to get on instead of shoving each other out of the way, the ride is smoother, and there are less stops.\xc2\xa0 It's more expensive for a roundtrip ticket since there aren't the same monthly passes anymore that MUNI has, but it's way less stressful.\xc2\xa0 Not to say you won't get stuck near a drunken sleeping stinky person now and again, but hey, that's living in a city.4.\xc2\xa0 Farmer's markets are cheaper - nothing quite beats Alemany in SF for prices but Oakland's have choices just as diverse for cheaper than even your average neighborhood farmer's market in SF.5.\xc2\xa0 It's friendlier - our new neighborhood is just as mixed racially as our SF one was, but we've met almost all of our neighbors and they say hi on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 I can't promise every neighborhood is like this, but other friends who used to live in SF who live in other parts of Oakland say they feel more connected to their neighbors here too.6.\xc2\xa0 It's more diverse age-wise - SF is starting to feel like it belongs to the very young and very old and neither has time for you if you're somewhere in the middle, with or without kids.\xc2\xa0 It just feels like people aren't competing with each other in terms of status or the coolest car/clothes/gadgets/app/restaurant recommendation/etc in Oakland.\xc2\xa0 More working-class people always bring that element down to earth with the rest of us.7.\xc2\xa0 The large natural areas are quieter - no concerts or drumming circles in Joaquin Miller Park, just miles and miles of trails to bike or walk or run.8.\xc2\xa0 You're closer to the big box stores when you want them in Emeryville or San Leandro - this counts for a lot when you're in a new home.9.\xc2\xa0 It's easier to get around by car - even though square footage-wise they're about the same, I can go pick up takeout Chinese food or run to the grocery store in a fraction of the time it took me to get around SF.\xc2\xa0 Even 580 heading east in the evening keeps moving unless there's a big accident because trucks/semis aren't allowed on the stretch of road that goes through the city.\xc2\xa0 (880 is another story.)10.\xc2\xa0 The zoo is WAY better.If you don't have a car, it's tough for sure - the bus system in Oakland is not ubiquitous like MUNI, so that's a big drawback for some people unless you live downtown near BART or a more reliable bus line.\xc2\xa0 I would guess what you save in rent (for now) would allow for a car payment and then some left over.\xc2\xa0 Parking is not nearly the problem here as it is in SF.It took a lot to convince my husband to move here but now he's happy and wouldn't have it any other way.\xc2\xa0 There are plans for more improvements already near Jack London Square and by the old naval hospital, and I can't imagine that trend won't continue as long as the overall economy stays healthy.\xc2\xa0 (Another bust will hit everyone hard, even those in SF.)Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 29, 'answer_user': 'Shankar Iyer'}, {'answer': 'I was born and raised in Berkeley. When I was twenty one I moved to San Francisco and lived in a transient hotel for a year on Union Square. It was fun to be somewhere so totally urban it wasn\'t even a real residential neighborhood. But I was glad to move to Polk Gulch and live at Sacramento and Polk for a year. Then I got married and we were offered a flat in Noe Valley. It was great to live in an old Victorian where I had an extra bedroom to use as my studio. I was going to the SF Art Institute at the time. After two years we were evicted so these friends of my parents could raise the rent. We found a place two blocks away at Vicksburg and Elizabeth where the landlady made it no secret she would evict us if she found out we were part of some kind of tenants rights group. After two years she evicted us so she could "mover her daughter in" to our place. At that point we got divorced and I moved to an attic above the Sushi bar\xc2\xa0 around the corner where I lived for another two or so years while I finished school. I went to grad school on the east coast for two years and when I came back I was married again and had a child. No one would rent to us in San Francisco except two gay men south of Market who beat the shit out of each other when they weren\'t having sex or rollerblading to disco music on their headphones in the middle of the night on Minna Street near Eighth where the flat was located. Finally we moved to Oakland, then back to Berkeley to my mothers house then to Richmond to an actually affordable house.Since then I have lived in El Cerrito, Richmond two more times, a cracker box apartment in Adams Point near Lake Merritt in Oakland, in a loft in West Oakland as well as Crockett. Yes you need a car to really check it all out and function practically but that is part of reality for the world we live in, most especially if you\'re over thirty and have kids or like to get around. Otherwise accept being viewed as a mark by the real estate interests here. They have never been friendly at any time in my life or in the lives of others I\'ve known who have been here longer than I have (which is over sixty years).I can tell you that all these places have something going for them if you know where you are, how close things really are and what the regional culture has to offer. Expand your horizons!The reality of crime is that it happens in urban places, period. If you\'re rich white and move in a sterile socio economic bubble and don\'t believe there is anything worth thinking about east of San Francisco (until you get to New York or any other similar corollary) my suggestion is that you\'re too narrow minded to know how to explore in the first place and you probably think San Francisco consists only of The Marina, North Beach, Fisherman\'s Wharf, The Financial District, SOMA (which was named for SOHO in New York to make us look as hip as New York, an eternal local neurosis, but in reality is called SOUTH OF MARKET) and then of course The Mission which to those recently arrived mostly means Valencia Street and a handful of currently trendy restaurants scattered across the large neighborhood. So you should stay there until your start up either folds or you can cash in your shares and move on. Those who have been here longer understand that there is a seamless region here that sort of starts in the northern Napa Valley (if not actually in Mendocino County) and extends to about Carmel or even Salinas going north to south and east goes to Brentwood and the Central Valley and Mount Diablo. This is called the San Francisco Bay Area. Don\'t make a provincial fool of yourself by thinking that only a microscopically small part of San Francisco is all that counts around here. It counts but it\'s only the smallest part of the beginning.

I chose the 2\xc2\xa0 bedroom apartment.\xc2\xa0 So first, the biggest overall negative of moving to Oakland:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\'t getting the invites I used to! All of my SF friends assumed I was unavailable for happy hour, etc. I\'d previously commuted SF -> Emeryville every day, why would people assume I\'d not come into SF for a more fun reason than work?\xc2\xa0 Ah, first world problems!\xc2\xa0 Now about Oakland itself:North Oakland: I am no stranger to bad neighborhoods, but this one tricked me.\xc2\xa0 The nice wide tree lined streets, strip of cute stores nearby, etc all made me think the place was pretty good.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, as with most of the Bay Area it is block by block... and I had some terrible neighbors.\xc2\xa0 Cops making police car barricades announcing "come out with your hands up" type bad. The property management company also was kind of annoying to deal with and didn\'t do repairs.\xc2\xa0 Also my half of the water bill was $250ish dollars.\xc2\xa0 So, a year and a half later I decide to move... to West Oakland.\xc2\xa0 Now my block looks sketchy, but feels safe - I have an even bigger yard, even bigger apartment (and my boyfriend moved in) for very little more than I was paying.\xc2\xa0 I now know great bars in Oakland and half the time my SF friends are coming out to drink on my side of the bay.\xc2\xa0 It\'s sunnier and warmer, and I have a great garden and fruit trees, and have looked at buying houses in the neighborhood. We bbq regularly on days where people are celebrating the fog and chill weather of SF. If we start to get chilled we light a fire in our backyard firepit.\xc2\xa0 I bike way more often now that there are no hills in the way. The transbay buses are amazing, and ACTransit has Muni beat so hard in general. West Oakland negatives 1.5 years in:We got burglarized once, and had yard stuff stolen by neighbors moving out once, and I definitely feel safer biking home than walking.\xc2\xa0 I have walked home before, and it was actually all fine, but ... I don\'t recommend it for my friends. Suburban friends get scared in my neighborhood, and there are a ton of barky pitbulls around.

To me, the difference between a good PM and a bad PM (or even an average one) is how well you can absorb great ideas or turn average ideas into really good ones. How well you code isn't relevant - except if that impacts your ability to understand the difference between a good idea or bad one.Which gets to my diversification point. You will want to get as broad an understanding about as many things as possible.

Why?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'It depends on the child and whether or not the parent(s) feels the child is mature and smart enough to handle all of those things. I lived in San Francisco from age 6 to 18. I started going to school by myself when I was 11 years old. I started going to the movies and shopping with only my friends (no parents) when I was 12. Overall, middle school was when I started going out without adult supervision. I think those are reasonable ages. My parents were strict and overprotective, but they trusted me. I just needed to answer ALL of their questions and gain permission before going anywhere. And back then, we didn\'t even have cellphones. We just had to trust each other and call when we reached some destination with a phone. And if I don\'t call, then I lose their trust in the future. Now, it\'s a lot easier and less stressful for a parent to communicate with the child.Also, I don\'t think you should be considering age if you\'re concerned about the county, which is San Francisco. The curfew and neighborhood matter more. In San Francisco, you should make sure that your child returns home before 5:00 pm or sundown, whichever one comes first. Of course, there may be special occasions like school dances where you can extend that curfew and also as they grow older. Also, there are bad neighborhoods where your children should never explore by themselves until they reach adulthood.Edit:I also want to add that the child must also feel like he/she feels comfortable going out by herself/himself. If the child says he (I\'m just going to use "he" now) is ready, then ask him how so. If his answer is mature enough, then it\'s okay to let him go. If the parent is ready and the child is not, then the parent should slowly prepare the child for it. Don\'t just forcefully push him into it; there is a reason why he is afraid. Maybe I over-answered your question or maybe you just wanted to get a survey instead of an opinion. Just to note, I\'m not a parent. Therefore, I cannot empathize with the anguish and worry some parents feel when their children leave them for the first time.

He told her about this hack he had learned from a friend (this seems to have been passed down!); she was skeptical, but he pointed out to her the extraordinarily low ceiling that marks the entrance (see this Google Maps street view).

Weekly is more likely to balance initial onboarding with a more rapid output. Monthly and more is better.I don't work set hours each day.I will more than likely move this towards monthly (retainer) or commitment periods to highlight level of investment and collaborations needed to have impact and add value, especially with product design and branding.Variations to the rate are dependant, first and foremost, on chemistry with the team potentially working with. Good people make the world of difference to your happiness contributing to a project.Other variations to the rate; the project in question, potential of project, company values and mission, commitment period, retainer options, equity, license, usage, timing and more. Not necessarily in that order.I don't bias or fluctuate rate on location or company size/worth. A set rate helps filter out the type of work you don't want and steers you to work better suited.Also, I don't change rate based on type of work i.e. Aesthetic changes, design, brand or consultation. Time investment required ensures that compensation is appropriate.This is usually rolled up into an overall project price (often what people want) along with roadmap and clear expectations but that usually takes a week or two to get to that point.

My wife joined Golden Gate Mothers Group and was put into one of three groups of moms having kids within a three month period just in SOMA.Startups intended for overworked well-paid tech workers - Instacart, Munchery, Postmates, Shyp, etc. are all godsends for overtired parents and they all start in SOMA.ConsUntreated mental illness and drug addiction - not a problem for parents, on the whole. There are folks who live in your neighborhood you talk to and get to know. But we lived near the ballpark, which brought in a different less-predictable crowd on game days.I am a bleeding heart liberal, but my compassion disappears when people act erratically around my kids.The assumption that no kids live in your neighborhood. Subtle, but really frustrating. Restaurants with no kids' seats, general rudeness towards families, etc. The new South Park plans don't have a playground. The proposal for the Warriors' new stadium bulldozes a great park for toddlers.Schools - pardon my french, but the SF school system is fucked. Your kid is put into a lottery that could have them going to the school up the street or across the city. The best school in town or the absolute worst.They fixed the system, they'll tell you, your kid is now more likely to end up in your neighborhood, but it's far from guaranteed. People that decide to take the risk always have private school options in their back pockets.High cost of everything - daycare/preschool basically cost as much as rent. Your rent plus preschool are the GDP of a small island nation. If your kid doesn't make it into the right public school, your company better be on the fast track to IPO.Incidentally, as we were planning to leave, our landlord listed our two bedroom for $1000/mo more than the exorbitant amount we were paying. It went so quickly he offered to pay us to move out early.Ultimately, it was the last two that drove us out of the city. I loved living there, but I also love working at small startups, I want my kids to be able to go to any college they want, and I want to eventually retire. I couldn't balance the risk to all of those priorities with our city lifestyle, so we moved.But yes, a baby.

Public schools encourage involvement and if you have a problem, there is a system for you to complain/fix things. Private schools basically say, "love it or leave it."

{'qid': 699, 'ans_num': 5, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85How does New York City's tech scene compare to Silicon Valley's?", 'answers': [{'answer': "Silicon Valley has a much deeper, ingrained tech culture than New York City, with the startup support ecosystem (in all its various formal and informal incarnations) omnipresent from Venture Capital on Sand Hill Road to every Starbucks.New York has a much more tight knit, faster-accelerating and City-supported tech scene, that has made it currently the fastest growing tech center in the world.The essential difference is that the Valley has been playing in the space for a much longer time, and to a large extent is a much smaller population, 'one-industry town'; in contrast, the NYC tech scene engages but a tiny fraction of an 8 million person metropolis, and competes with a dozen other industries. However, because of the overall size, economy, culture and general speed of life in New York, the relatively young tech scene is rapidly equalling the Valley in objective size.To put things in perspective, the monthly NY Tech Meetup has over 20,000 members, and a couple of months ago the lead speaker at it was Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the city's local leading tech entrepreneur billionaire (who reminisced about hand-assembling circuit boards for his early customers).As others have mentioned, there are proportionately a lot more coders in the Valley, and lot more entrepreneurs in the City. The overriding need in New York now is for raw, hardcore tech talent, which is why New York is spearheading a new billion dollar tech campus (probably from Cornell University) ... despite the fact that New York already has more college students than Boston has population.Embed QuoteVia  Jason Yun.Suggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 13, 'answer_user': 'David S.

{'qid': 700, 'ans_num': 3, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85As a soon to be fresh college graduate, what would be the pro and con arguments for living in New York City vs San Fransisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'I\'m not sure that either one is a great place for a fresh college graduate, though I don\'t fully know, because I\'m a bit older. If I were 22 I\'d seriously consider Austin-- it seems like a place for builders and makers rather than VC-land climbers-- although (especially at your age) the quality of the job matters much more than the city you\'ll be living in. I say that because, when you\'re young, the people immediately around you matter more than the city itself, and whether you find good people is up to you, not the place you live. Cost of living: they\'re both extremely expensive. You won\'t save for shit in the first 5 years. If you hit a bad patch, get fired without severance, or there\'s another dot-com implosion and the job market becomes less liquid, your net worth will probably go into the negative. California might be more forgiving than New York is, though. If I were to be broke in one place or the other, I\'d pick California but largely because I\'ve been broke (startup failure) in NYC and it\'s awful. I\'m not entirely sure, but I\'d guess that even when you\'re broke in California, there\'s still stuff you can enjoy. Being broke in NYC shuts your social life down because people meet friends not in their houses but at restaurants and bars, and when you\'re broke, you start avoiding those places. Weather: unless you have SAD, don\'t even think about this in your 20s. It\'s not an important variable. Your career is more important than a couple hundred additional hours of sunlight per year. (New York has a couple miserable weeks in summer and winter, but the climate isn\'t bad overall.) If, however, you have SAD, you want California. New York is much more SAD-inducing than you\'d think based on its moderate latitude (only 40.7 degrees) because of the buildings-- "urban sunset" is around 3:00 in the winter-- and long work hours. Job market: this is the most important variable. Right now, there are more technology jobs-- and especially more interesting ones-- in California. New York\'s economy is mostly around finance, and the VC-funded companies are much lower in quality because New York\'s best people are mostly in finance. The technology scene in New York is high on quantity, low on quality, and probably not worth what you pay-- unless you\'re doing finance, in which case it\'s the best place in the country. The good news of New York and San Francisco both is that there are a lot of jobs in each area; the bad news is that you\'ll have to execute any unexpected job searches quickly because your finances will be for-shit until you\'re well into your career. People: I lived in New York for 7 years and I don\'t regret it. Many of the experiences were negative, but you learn a certain class of social skills when you\'re surrounded by so many people, and so many different kinds, and when you experience in real-time what it\'s like to be taken advantage of. There are a lot of hard lessons you learn quickly in NYC that you might never learn in a more subtle place. I\'m thankful for that. Longevity/exit strategy: After about 10 years, you\'ll probably get sick of the high cost of living. I think, and this is largely a guess, that New York will have you better prepared for moving elsewhere than San Francisco. New York forces you to learn what urban amenities you care about, and which you don\'t. You see the good and the bad in a city where those are so meshed together that even the rich don\'t get to pry them apart (even billionaires in black cars have to endure Manhattan traffic). I would guess that people who exit from New York end up in still interesting but less demanding places (Chicago, Philly, Seattle) more suited to their individual preferences, while those who exit from California just end up in suburban asteroid belts with 2-hour commutes that make career advancement impossible. Income trajectory: New York has lower variation but a surer path. If you come to New York and put in 5 solid years, you will be making $150,000 per year if you play your cards right. In California, you have the extreme off chance of a liquidity event delivering a pile of cash; but you might also be broke in 5 years. I think the median case for advancement is much better in New York. On the other hand, you\'re not going to be next Elon Musk in New York. An upper-middle-class lifestyle isn\'t hard to get, but the only people who get the $5+ million payouts in NYC are the ones who love finance (esp. trading, which stokes some peoples\' competitive impulses) so much that they can\'t imagine doing anything else. Interesting work: to assess this one, it\'s important to separate the macro from the micro concerns. The macro side pertains to whether companies are doing things that are attractive from the outside. The micro perspective pertains to what you will be doing, day to day. San Francisco pwns New York on the macroscopic stuff (consumer apps that get "Techcrunched" are more interesting than shaving 50 mikes off a ultra-low latency trading algo, an accomplishment that no one outside of your firm will even know about) but, in terms of the microscopic concern of how interesting your work will be-- even at macroscopically interesting companies, you usually won\'t get good projects at age 22-- I think they\'re comparable and New York might even be better, just because trading is much more of a meritocracy than VC-funded technology. Industry-specific: If you want to do finance, New York is a credible option and San Francisco is not. If you want to do VC-funded technology startups, then don\'t even consider New York because (as much as I prefer New York over California) its scene is a joke in comparison.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 7, 'answer_user': 'Michael O.

You have a much larger labor market in NYC for executives and strong individual contributors with experience in luxury goods, retail, and in some cases physical supply chain management for these industries. A potentially less-competitive recruiting environment for young technical talent. Both NYC and San Francisco / Silicon Valley have access to regional schools with strong computer science and engineering programs. But the startup demand for these graduates in California is much higher due to a much larger startup ecosystem - nearly 3x New York City's by some accounts. The smaller size of NYC's ecosystem means a lower demand for young engineers, which (holding the supply of said engineers constant) leads to a less-competitive recruiting environment and a lower cost per engineer.Wall Street. It's arguably easier to find a personal connection to someone at a major bank or east coast hedge fund in NYC than it is in San Francisco. Fintech startups focused on B2B in these areas might thus benefit from more high-quality leads. Also, finding and closing candidates with high finance experience is probably going to be easier in NYC given the abundance of young high-churn banking and PE workers.All of these points apply just as much for investors as they do for startups.

{'qid': 709, 'ans_num': 7, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85What are the differences in nightlife culture between San Francisco and New York City?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'This is who you\'ll run into clubbing in New York:This is who you\'ll run into clubbing in San Francisco:Nightlife is another synecdoche for the social dichotomy of finance-obsessed New York vs. high tech-obsessed San Francisco. Many of the key differences in norms, behavior, and the overall ambience of each\'s scenes are emblematic of this core difference between SF and NYC.Given that, let\'s drill down and get to specifics:Size: It\'s obvious that Manhattan is a lot bigger than downtown San Francisco. As such, there\'s fewer places to go out in SF than there are in NYC. Unlike New York, it\'s really hard to "hide" from people you know and you\'ll constantly run into people you recognize - whether you want to or not. The nightlife culture in SF is also a lot less popular than it is in NYC due to its smaller size, and people tend to take going out in SF a lot less serious than they do in NYC.Last Call: In SF last call is firmly put at 2AM. In NYC some clubs close at 4AM for "cleaning." Because of this, the night in SF starts a lot sooner - usually at around 9-10PM. Demographics: Huge differences. New York has more girls than guys (anecdotally like a 6:1 girl to guy ratio but more likely less than that). San Francisco, as a consequence of its high tech nature, is much more slanted towards more guys to girls. It\'s not as bad as it is in the other parts of the Bay Area (see: [M]an Jose) but it\'s by no means an even split. San Francisco is also more Asian than the much more ethnically diverse New York City. This isn\'t to say that you won\'t party with a lot of Asians in New York (see: Circle). But San Francisco is a hub of Chinese American culture and its nightlife is no exception. There also are a lot fewer Europeans in SF than there are in NYC, leaving the Meatpacking phenomena of ultra-rich 6\'+ Nordic women with platinum blond hair an alien concept to most San Franciscans. Price: San Francisco is getting progressively more expensive due to tech coming back strong after 2k8 and downtown\'s sociopolitical demographics beginning to closely mirror Manhattan\'s. But New York is still generally more expensive, and a high spend "big" night out in NYC is still astronomically more expensive than it would be in SF. Best way to look at this is to go through an example. Let\'s say you want to go out and have an upscale bar + club experience. Here\'s what you\'re looking at for a night out in SF:Beer: $6-10 / bottle at an upscale club or bar. Cocktail: $10-15 at at an upscale club or bar. For artisan bars like Bourbon and Branch this could be higher. Cover: Cover is between $5-$15 for most places even on premium nights like Friday and Saturday. Some places like Bootie SF or The Grand will be more expensive.Shows: An A-list show like Avicii at Ruby Skye will probably cost around $45-50. Bottle Service: Most bottles start at around $250-300 per bottle, and minimums are usually in the $300-400 / 5-6 people range. Let\'s compare that to a night out in New York:Beer: Same. Cocktail: Also the same. This is one of the areas where SF has caught up to NYC, and a night of bar crawling will probably cost you about the same. Cover: More expensive. For solid clubs like Tenjune cover starts at around $20. Shows: Also more expensive. The same show at somewhere like Marquee will be between $50 - $100. Bottle Service: Much more expensive. Table minimums for 6 person groups at places like Marquee or 1OAK are easily in the thousands of dollars. Per bottle is roughly the same if not a little more. There is one cost hidden in all of this that San Francisco is more expensive than Manhattan on: travel.\xc2\xa0SF is terrible at public transportation, and SF Muni is comical compared to the NYC subway system. The Bay Area\'s regional transportation solutions - Caltrain and BART - both stop running at 12:05. As such, you\'re much more likely to run up a large Uber bill in SF than you are in NYC. Lyft and Sidecar are seen as the sensible, cheaper alternatives. But you\'ll be hard pressed to find availability in either come 2:00AM. Style: Clubbing attire for girls is basically the same in New York as it is in San Francsico. My girlfriend would disagree with me here and note that Manhattan women tend to be much more materialistic and spend more money on expensive shoes + jewelry for going out, and I\'d agree with her. But for all intents and purposes the average girl you meet at The Grand will probably be dressed similar to someone you meet at 1OAK. It\'s a completely different story for guys. This goes back to the "cool" industries for 20-somethings in both cities. Rocking the Herm\xc3\xa8s tie, expensive pocket square, and tailored suit in Manhattan is cool and emblematic of high finance. But in tech it\'s way cooler to go against the grain of business and be disruptive. Nightlife is no exception. Guys purposely dress down to show how little they need to do to get into the club - a peacock-like show of cool that is the opposite of dressing up to show how rich you are that ironicaly has the same (douchey) purpose. Because it\'s cool to "not try", SF magnates like The Grand will thus happily let in guys t-shirts and jeans, so long as that t-shirt says "Facebook" on it and the guy is wearing expensive shoes and a fitbit flex. Collared shirts and blazers are seen as the high bar of dressing up in SF, whereas they\'re almost casual in New YorkIt\'s also worth noting that this lax regard to dress code benefits women as well, and girl engineers in t-shirts and jeans are visible (and welcome) parts of SF nightlife. This would be heretical in most parts of Manhattan. Music: NYC seems to be much more musically diverse than San Francisco as well. Top 40 and hip hop are much better represented in Manhattan than they are in San Francisco. San Francisco is much more focused on EDM and alternative rock, though you could easily make the case that the latter has just as strong a foothold in Brooklyn thanks to hipster conclaves such as Williamsburg.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 187, 'answer_user': 'Andy Manoske'}, {'answer': 'We actually looked at this directly using data from Chronos -- the full post is here, but a teaser of types of places go to in each (these are non-home/work places that people go to at night in each city):Top 40 places of where people go out\xe2\x80\x94red is drinking, blue is eating, orange is cultural experience, and green is other.We dug into this and a lot more SF vs New York comparisons on the Chronos Insights Blog here: San Francisco vs New York (1 of 2)Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 23, 'answer_user': 'Charlie Kubal'}, {'answer': 'San Francisco closes, New York does not.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 28, 'answer_user': 'Shannon Sofield'}, {'answer': "It's been a few years for me, but a very notable difference is that most nightlife in San Francisco starts winding down at 1:30 and comes to a halt at 2 am.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 8, 'answer_user': 'Ian McCullough'}, {'answer': "In terms of what people tend to drink, I'd say SF leans more towards microbrews and fine wine (given the proximity of wine country and tons of microbreweries).

interpretations:Silicon Valley is much more tech- (cloud, hacker, dev, engineer, software, programmer) and startup-driven (startup, entrepreneur, founder). New York is much more into arts/entertainment (actress, theatre, publishing, studio, records, magazine, journalism, filmmaker, news) and finance (money, financial). (Another way to look at it: Silicon Valley higher-ups call themselves ctos and founders, while New York higher-ups call themselves presidents and executives.)New Yorkers care a lot about looks (makeup, fashion). Silicon Valley folks care a lot about sports and health (bike, surfer, cyclist, yoga, running, health).Silicon Valley folks describe themselves through their past (before, formerly, past, former). New Yorkers describe themselves through their future (dreams). (Several ways to interpret this. Maybe SV folks tend to have had more jobs, while NY folks hope to try new things, or maybe SV folks are just older.)Silicon Valley is big on community (support, team, help, helping, community). New York is focused on the individual (self, myself).Silicon Valley has a larger proportion of men (dad, geek). New York has the women (mother, chick).Silicon Valley is more into the locavore movement (green, local).(Note, though, that the data is biased in that it\'s only comparing people who use Twitter.)*I trained a simple Naive Bayes model on Twitter profiles, and these were the words most predictive of being from NY vs. SV. (After keeping only diverse "cultural" words in order to respond better to the question, e.g., filtering out slang words, location words, and too many words of the same type.)Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 466, 'answer_user': 'Edwin Chen'}, {'answer': 'Having lived in NYC for 6 years and SF on and off for 4 years, here are some cultural observations in no particular order:Diversity of industries:\xc2\xa0 In SF, technology is the strongest industry just as in LA, Hollywood dominates and DC has politics.\xc2\xa0 NYC has more diversity of strong industries (finance, fashion, publishing, media, advertising) so the people you meet will likely be more diverse in their fields of work and interests.\xc2\xa0 You may have less stimulating conversations about your work but your work may also define you less.Culture of convenience and feeling like you\'re missing out: NYC emphasizes convenience and how you can get almost anything at any time, which can create some general anxiety as you can feel like if you\'re not\xc2\xa0 "experiencing" all NYC has to offer, you\'re missing out.\xc2\xa0 This feeling goes away after living there a while, but most people in SF don\'t get the feeling of needing to optimize their time and experiences because things shut down earlier and there may be only a handful of events going on each night.\xc2\xa0 People also don\'t tend to schedule 2-3 events in one night (e.g. pre-dinner drinks, dinner, post dinner drinks) in SF.\xc2\xa0 If you make plans with someone in SF, they will likely expect that you will be with them for the duration of the night.Obsession with long, outdoor workouts:\xc2\xa0 Bay Area people *really* like to talk about physical feats, e.g. running Mt. Tam, "escaping" Alcatraz a.k.a. swimming in freezing waters for fun, or their training for a mere marathon.\xc2\xa0 This is part of people\'s every day conversation especially as it relates to what they\'ll be doing on the weekend.\xc2\xa0 For the most part, NY\'ers do not talk about their workouts as religiously and seem to work out more indoors.Pervasive technical savvy: If an SF cab driver complains about how 5-10% is being taken from their fare if you use a credit card to pay, someone may suggest to the driver to use Square and the cab driver will actually know what that means.\xc2\xa0 99% chance this would not happen in NYC.Popular vacation spots: SF people tend to vacation in Hawaii and roadtrip on weekends to Tahoe, Big Sur, or Napa/Sonoma.\xc2\xa0 NYC people tend to vacation in Europe and roadtrip to the Hamptons/Berkshires/Jersey Shore (summer) or Vermont /Miami, which is not a far flight away (winter).\xc2\xa0 This is a huge generalization as people travel anywhere, but just relates to physical proximity of the two cities to vacation spots. In general, people in the Bay Area spend a lot more time outdoors in nature as there is much easier access than in NYC.Knowledge of how to operate a vehicle: Many native Manhattanites never learned how to drive (or not until their 20s) since public transport is the best way to commute in the city.\xc2\xa0 Most native San Franciscans know how to drive, but may choose not to.Fashion sense: Due to the SF micro-climates (or possibly less emphasis on fashion), SF people wear *way* more fleece year round than the average U.S. population.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, there also really isn\'t a season (except maybe October) for the beloved "summer sundress" in SF unless you live in the Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 NYC has distinctly four seasons and one definitely needs to dress appropriately for each one in order to stay warm or cool.Gender ratio and the 6/8 phenomenon: There are noticeably more women than men in NYC and the opposite is true in SF.\xc2\xa0 There are also more models in NYC than SF so women who were "8" on a scale of 1-10 for looks in SF, may be a "6" in NYC where there are more women and a population whose profession is based completely on their physical attributes.\xc2\xa0 There are way more important characteristics that makes one "attractive" than one\'s looks but there is more of an emphasis on them in NYC than SF.Risk appetite of entrepreneurs: Tech entrepreneurs in the Valley dream bigger and want to disrupt industries more than entrepreneurs in NYC.\xc2\xa0 More entrepreneurs in NYC will sell their companies for the "right" price than entrepreneurs in the Valley where people are swinging for home runs vs. single or doubles.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have empirical data to support this theory but this is a general observation having been part of the start-up community in both cities.Abundance of arts and culture: There is way more arts and culture in NYC than SF.\xc2\xa0 NYC considers itself the world\'s capital and as such, it gets every great act and has a much larger, thriving arts community (off Broadway, Broadway, numerous art galleries) than SF.\xc2\xa0 However, having recently moved to SF, I don\'t feel that arts is lacking in SF as there is only so much arts I\'d typically take in anyways.Diversity of people and food: NYC has more ethnic diversity and different nationalities than SF, which is reflected in the diversity and authenticity of cuisines from around the world.\xc2\xa0 SF seems more white with growing Asian and Hispanic populations, which is also reflected in the many Asian/Asian Fusion and arguably better Mexican restaurants.12. Strong sense of community: Maybe because of its smaller size, but there is a real sense of community in the Bay Area.\xc2\xa0 For example, 12K+ people volunteered to create "Gotham" city for Bat Kid (a 5 year battling leukemia whose wish for a day was to be "bat kid.")\xc2\xa0 People in NYC rally around natural disasters and terrorist attacks, but I haven\'t witnessed this kind of ground swelling support for an individual when I lived in NYC.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 97, 'answer_user': 'Amanda Terry'}, {'answer': 'Live in NY and SF for 10 years each.\xc2\xa0 I always say in brief:\xc2\xa0 "New York is for the very young and very rich.\xc2\xa0 When you are young you don\'t mind living in a rat infested 5th floor walk up with 5 other people because you.are.in.newyork.\xc2\xa0 When you\'re rich, you can insulate yourself from the hardships of life there--noise, crowds, crime, weather." \xc2\xa0To elaborate....Both cities are narcissistic, but in their own way.\xc2\xa0 New Yorkers will brag about that club, that watch, that play, that dress, bank account etc.\xc2\xa0 SFers will brag about their physical fitness (I hiked half dome, then stopped for a soy latte smoothie and walked back to SF on my hands). Ask someone in NY what they did last weekend, and it\'s usually about something intelligent and sophisticated.\xc2\xa0 Ask an SF person and it\'s usually how many miles they ran.In NY, people at least pretend to read books.\xc2\xa0 In SF in general in spite of the higher education I find that most people don\'t read as much.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t mean internet, blogs, quora, etc.The art galleries and art scene in NY is incredible, but much more expensive.\xc2\xa0 Lots of great art in SF at a much lower cost but not as much of it will make you weep at its beauty.Fresh produce and eating healthfully--no question hands down SF has better food quality and restaurants serving healthy food; though food technique is more refined in NYC.\xc2\xa0 Think Chez Panisse vs. WD-50.\xc2\xa0 Friend of mine who moved to NY from SF went to Whole Foods in Columbus circle in January and got a real shock at what was available--i.e. pink tomatoes, and none of them local.There is little to no Orthodox jewish culture in the bay area and Jews as a % of the population appear to have less or more secular influence on the culture. Less razor sharp comedy, less wit and sarcasm, etc (not to mention an absence of bagels. ;) There are many more African Americans in NYC as a % of the culture--NYC is in fact much more multicultural in general than SF, which is becoming more and more white and Asian only.I noticed in my last visit to NYC that the average person just isn\'t as technically savvy, less interested in iPad/iPhone for its beauty and usability than it as a status symbol.\xc2\xa0 So technology there is a means to an end--in SF of course it is the end.(adding since quora had a bug that locked me out).\xc2\xa0 SF shuts down earlier.\xc2\xa0 you eat here at 7-8pm, not 9-10pm.More people in SF own cars because our public transportation is awful.\xc2\xa0 Muni, I hate you.More SF people are into eastern philosophies and Yoga, and work life balance here is easier to achieve.\xc2\xa0 Sure a lot of startup folks work long hours, but if one wants to cut back there\'s little judgment.New Yorkers do cocaine, SFers smoke pot.\xc2\xa0 This explains a lot of the above.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 72, 'answer_user': 'Melinda Byerley'}, {'answer': "**Broad Generalization Warning: There are cultural sub-pockets in SV and NYC that don't fit my thesis, but I believe what follows is generally true***Culturally, New York City is generally about optimizing for the present, while Silicon Valley is about optimizing for the future. Everything in New York is orientated toward maximizing the now.This is probably a direct outgrowth of what have historically been the driving force industries in NYC vs SV:NYC:Media\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 [what news is breaking now]Finance [what trades can I make to profit now]Fashion [what trends are breaking now]SV:Tech [forgoing short term gain to create value for the future]\xc2\xa0The average person in New York doesn't get excited about how big your Company may be one day, they get excited about how much money you have in your pockets, now. In New York, external stimulation is everywhere. Want an amazing meal at 4:00 in the morning? Easy. Best theatre in the world? Done. Most beautiful people? Everywhere. This omnipresent temptation fuels the present-tense way of life. New Yorkers are impatient for a reason.The result is an exhilarating but somewhat attention deficit [and exhausting] way of life.Comparatively, Silicon Valley is incredibly patient. Want an amazing meal at 4:00 in the morning? Cook it yourself. Great clubs? You'll have to fly to LA. The stimulation tends to be internal -- ideas, concepts, taking the time to develop and build. Playing Settlers of Catan around a kitchen table for hours instead of rushing from club to club in an attempt to maximize the moment. New York City is the endless city. Living here feels like being in a movie, each moment, 24/7. You live for the moment.

In San Francisco, you pretend to be poor, especially if you're not.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 23, 'answer_user': 'Nikhil Nirmel'}, {'answer': 'I was born and raised in Manhattan, lived there to 24, then Brooklyn until 32. I have now been in San Francisco for a little over 2 years. Here are some key differences between the cities that will affect how you live there. Anything I say here needs to be taken with a grain of salt - I am making some broad strokes for the sake of simplicity. The cities are quite similar, but fundamentally SF is smaller "feeling" and a lot of its personality is not diluted due to the smaller population. With NYC\'s massive population, you can find it all and are never at a loss for an extreme. I just feel that in SF, they are easier to spot since there is less "noise". Last disclaimer, I don\'t feel one way or the other about SF or NY - for all intensive purposes I feel at home in both cities and love them both, but these are some nuances that I have noticed.Clothes/FashionSF has a very "hip" culture. I would say that NY has a very "fashionable" culture. NY is way more business oriented, especially in the dress code, SF is not at all. Moving here changed my entire wardrobe. The rare exception here is if you worked at a Bank or at a financial company. For the most part however, people here dress business casual. Of course, NY being what it is - you see all fashion there. But when I lived in the city, and even in Brooklyn commuting in - the trains were packed with suits. Here it is not the case - especially not in the NYC volume. This affects your closet and your wallet - if you care. PoliticsNY is a democratic city - no doubt. But SF, takes the cake. Sure NY birthed the occupy movement. They have Wall Street. In SF, you can\'t walk 5 steps without running into Greenpeace, an Occupier or some other activist. At grocery stores you are bombarded with petitions, "are you registered to vote", for pot legalization, to taxes, or something else ridiculous like passing a resolution to stop turning a golf course into a building in Alameda. Not a bad thing, but something very different than NYC. This affects your grocery runs, walks down the street and lunch breaks. Food/HealthWow. SF is healthier. No doubt, the food options here are awesome. They also offer a ton of local sustainable options. Restaurants are smaller and more intimate, prices can be very high, but there is also a lot of value out here. Food truck mecca. Yelp is king - trust it. In NYC however, you have amazing institutions of food, like Two if by land, One if by sea. Little Italy, ridiculous Italian food and pizzas, bagels - seriously. There is no bagel or pizza like a NY one. The first thing many NY\'ers do going back home is getting bagels and pizza. Farmers markets everywhere and you\'ll probably not cook at home. I think that is sort of NY\'ish too, but I feel that the quality of the produce here is amazing. Heads and shoulders above NYC. Work/LifeNYC you live to work. In SF, you live and work. Sure you work hard, but offices have amazing perks and really try to respect employees. NYC - they work you to the bone. Not to say you don\'t work hard in SF, but the engineering culture has instilled benefits and competitive compensation packages to attract talent. This ends up benefiting every employee. NYC is a winner take all city, you get run over if you stand still in the business world. Here they will nudge you out of the way, passive aggressively. Not ideological differences:TransportationNYC Subway and bus system is a dream! I never knew how amazing, how valuable, how well priced and affordable the NYC transit system is. it is ingenious. Taxis are fantastic in NY. Basically, take everything I said and inverse it for SF. their transit is horrible, Taxi\'s - here they are hell, if you can catch one. They have no respect for consumers and the TLC here is definitely not as scary as the one in NYC. Cabbies there are way better. I swear.Miscellaneous:NY - open all night. SF closes at 1:30 - hence, start your night earlier. Tiny Broadway in SF with short run shows, exact opposite in NYC of courseBaseball in the city in SF - love that. Outer boroughs for NYC.SF is on the Ocean and has a gorgeous landscape surrounding it (however it\'s colder in summer) NYC is an island with no beach, surrounded by land.In NYC you drive to the outdoors, here you can walk/bike to it. The hiking is close and amazing.Hope this helps.

You'll see a holdup in the foreground on the right, and a traffic cop and a mailman who seem oblivious to the holdup on the left: Source: Wikipedia Commons at File:Coit Mural.jpgOf course this is an exaggeration for the storytelling purposes of the mural, but street life must have been more lively back then, as more people walked and there were far fewer cars. But not always. Here's a picture of the Monkey Block as it existed back in the 1930s, taken from another corner of the intersection:Source:SF Public Library, SF History Center via Found SF Poet Kenneth Rexroth's account Bohemian San Francisco Between the Wars describes how rustic and rickety parts of Telegraph Hill were at the time, and how the Italian influence impacted city life:Most of the hill was still unpaved. There weren\xe2\x80\x99t even real streets on the north side and only rickety wooden staircases on the east. Two different old ladies herded goats in the vacant lots and kept them at night in barns that were part of their own homes. The Italians were almost all from North Italy, the largest contingent from Lucca. To this day the Lucchese have the largest town club in the Bay Area, and\xc2\xa0 whenever I have visited Lucca all sorts of people greet me by name and invite me for a drink.At harvest time the gutters were purple with overflowing refuse from the vine presses, and an atmosphere of wholesome orgy borne on the strains of mandolins, guitars and accordions enveloped the whole hill. This Latin virt\xc3\xba communicated itself most infectiously to the scattered bohemians who still constituted a very small minority. San Francisco must have been the only city in the United States where intellectuals drank wine rather than hard liquor or cocktails at their parties.Some places down near the water were rustic as well. Here's a photo of Izzy Gomez' saloon at 848 Pacific Avenue in the heart of the red light district or Barbary Coast, not far from the Monkey Block. This photo is actually from the 1950s, when the saloon was being torn down:Source:SF Public Library, SF History Center via Found SFSan Franciscans, including Mayor Jim Rolph, didn't believe in Prohibition, and the police were told at one time not to enforce the law, apparently, according to author and historian James R. Smith in San Francisco History | Guidelines Newsletter The first-hand accounts are rich with detail but all highly contextual. Much of the publicly archived material has to do with the social, labor, cultural or political movements of the time and tends to stress the plight of the proletariat. If you were employed or growing up in a family that owned a home in one of the neighborhoods, your vantage point was much different from that of someone living on the street, and you were somewhat insulated. If you lived in Pacific Heights or worked at one of the consulates there (such as the Gibbs mansion designed by SF architect Willis Polk and used as the Japanese consulate before the war), you were in another world...

{'qid': 736, 'ans_num': 2, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85How devastating was the last big earthquake in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'The Loma Prieta Earthquake (October 17, 1989) was quite devastating:The Marina (San Francisco neighborhood) had a serious fire that destroyed several homes and killed some people.The Bay Bridge had a partial collapse of its cantilever section (east of Yerba Buena Island; one car with a single driver fell into the hole and was killed); the bridge was down for a month. BART operated 24/7 during that time to try and take up some slack. That section of the bridge is in the process of being totally replaced.As Andrew Gutsch\'s answer notes, the "cypress structure" of I-880 ("the Nimitz Freeway") in Oakland collapsed, crushing the majority of those who died in the natural disaster. I-480 ("the Embarcadero Freeway") above the San Francisco waterfront had the same structure, did not collapse (fortunately), and has been dismantled. I-880 was ... reworked.Several people were killed in building fa\xc3\xa7ade collapses in Santa Cruz, and SOMA.There were widespread power outages.Mostly, though, people were resilient, and dealt with the problems in front of them with the resources they had at hand, especially since everyone knew we\'d had a very serious earthquake (it was pretty obvious), the emergency services would be severely strained, and it might take a while for them to get to you.The residents around the cypress structure in Oakland came out of their homes with ladders and anything else they could find to put out car fires and rescue as many people as they could.Reportedly, homeless people stood up at various street intersections in San Francisco when the traffic lights went out, and directed traffic.The people in Candlestick Park, waiting for the third game of the "Bay Bridge World Series" Baseball championship (the Oakland Athletics were playing against the San Francisco Giants - both bay area teams on either side of the Bay Bridge) didn\'t panic, and left the stadium quietly when the game was cancelled. This was also the imputed cause of lighter than normal rush hour traffic on the highways (the quake hit at 17:04 PDT); people were already at home, or someplace else, to watch the game.I was at my desk in Valley Green 3 at Apple (company) in Cupertino (only 10 miles from the quake epicenter), and then under my desk as soon as I figured out we were experiencing a serious earthquake. Fortunately, the tilt-up building did not pancake on my (or my co-workers\') head.After the shaking stopped, I found a phone that was still working (about a third were out), and called my Dad at his office, and my Mom at their home (left a message), to let them know I was OK. I found out later that Mom had been out shopping in the north bay. A few cans fell off the shelves in the grocery store, but no big deal to her. When she got home and found that I\'d called, then she turned on the TV, saw the Bay Bridge collapsed, the Marina on fire ...If there\'s anything that natural disaster taught me, it\'s that in times of true crisis, it\'s your neighbors (or co-workers) you will be relying on, rather than the government. This is why I became (and still am) angry at the Congress and George W. Bush for their response to the 9/11 (terrorist attack): they did nothing but instill Fear and install Police State controls (cf. USA PATRIOT Act; National Security Letters, Mass Surveillance), rather than cultivate resilience and confidence in our ability to withstand & respond to such events.See also my answer to 9/11: How did Quora members react to the attacks of September 11th, 2001?Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 24, 'answer_user': 'Erik Fair'}, {'answer': 'The Loma Prieta Earthquake (October 17, 1989) killed 63, injured 3,757, left a couple thousand homeless and caused $6 billion (1989 dollars) in damage.The quake was so violent, that my mother dove over me at a stop light because she feared the light struture was going to fall onto the car, in Santa Rosa, CA.My father drove over this, the "Cypress structure" of I-880 in Oakland, minutes before its collapse.

Even during the first dot com bubble La Mish kept most of it's edginess and was still affordable for local residents to make art and open small unique businesses with their own money. Now that the 1% has sniffed out the Mission and is investing heavily in million dollar build outs for more fancy restaurants and other entertainments we see a huge schism between daytime business, (locals, some tourists) and night time business (party people, out of towners and the super rich looking for edgy cred) So what you get is rents forever artificially raised while small daytime business is stagnant. At night you get a neighborhood full of folks who have no connection to locals; coming in to eat, party and make noise at night. If all goes well and those investors keep getting good ROI on their investments we will probably continue to gentrify and serve the visitors (and the locals who are left) in the neighborhood with dignity. If people get tired of the Mission or it becomes boring with an overbalance of expensive fancy joints then I see potentially a neighborhood being deserted by investors and businesses leaving for greener pastures. Even the well paid young people flooding this neighborhood will eventually leave to raise families in an easier environment. While the residential rental market will continue to seek to get the higher rents and the local residents are stuck in their rent controlled apartments.I'm not trying to vilify any particular group but to look realistically at the changes that have occurred. As a resident for over 20 years and the owner of tiny micro business I know that brick and mortar retail may be going the way of the buggy whip and perhaps the current incarnation of the Mission is exactly what the residents want more of. Disruption is the term of the day and the Mission is part of it. I hope it turns out to be great and not a disappointment for future residents and visitors to the Mission.

San Francisco will tear itself apart at the seams, with only the homeless shopping cart pushers to pick up the pieces.While not as revolutionary as the denizens of Berkeley (see the history of People's Park), San Francisco's hipsters won't surrender without a fight. Besides, it would be too conformist to leave like everyone else when the police come. The evacuation of the park will be disorderly, dragging on for months, and will be plagued by poor enforcement. When the time finally comes that the hipsters are afraid to sneak back in, the only parkgoers remaining (apart from the transients sleeping in it) will be outlaws riding in on BART from far-off locales like Pleasanton, who have no attachment to the place, and who will pile up contraband and trash faster than the city can clean it up.Without the readily available seating in the park, crowds at Bi-Rite and Tartine will linger on the sidewalk outside, growing to epic proportions. NIMBY neighbors will be driven to madness and demand their shutdown, as they have with Ike's (see http://sfist.com/2010/06/28/nimb...). The loss of these indulgences will set forth a cascade of events, a sequence of reactions, in which the few remaining comforts in life will be cruelly taken away, and everything that can be cracked down upon will be. Without ice cream or sandwiches, beer abuse will become an epidemic, so alcohol will be first to go, thanks to the notorious California ABC; following shortly thereafter will be brakeless fixies. Victory will be declared in the War on Fun (see http://www.stopthewaronfun.org/), but the spectre of Prohibition will appear, with speakeasies and other unlicensed underground acts returning in force. Latter-day Al Capones will shoot each other in broad daylight. Coffee distributors, such as Ritual Roasters, feeling left behind by the excitement, will form a cartel, and affordable macchiatos will become a dim memory of the past.The few who have not lost their heads and manage to keep a semblance of their social fabric intact will, instead of gathering in public, meet in private residences. None of them will ever meet a new person.That's fine, you might say, but how will this affect the rest of San Francisco? Well, it's pretty clear that city services will be pushed off the brink of collapse. Also, property values will fall around the Mission, the Castro, and Noe Valley as the park transforms from an amenity to a liability; the poor who could never afford to live in the city will find new possibilities; and hipsters will find the area has really become too authentically dangerous.

This is very close to either highway (you can turn east on Golden Gate, which feeds into 280, or head south on Gough to 101). Hayes Valley doesn't have a ton of nightlife, but there are cool shops and restaurants, and it's within reasonable distance of The Mission and Haight, depending on where you are located.\xc2\xa0 This also depends on what you mean by 'liveliness'. Noe Valley has a bunch of stores and restaurants, and is a vibrant neighborhood, but there isn't much nightlife. It's also difficult to get from Noe Valley to other neighborhoods for nightlife, as there are no cabs, so you'll have to rely on public transportation, or spend obscene amounts of money on Uber.\xc2\xa0 I would also say that SoMa has way less in terms of liveliness than the other neighborhoods. SoMa can be dreary at times, and unless you are a CalTrain devotee, my personal take is it's not worth living there. Also, many of the apartments around SoMa are newer constructions, and you definitely pay a premium for them, which I would argue is not worth the extra cost. Case in point: two friends paid above $3K / month for a place in The Beacon, which has all the charm of a business hotel, and isn't in a particularly interesting neighborhood, either. SoMa is huge, too - there are many places you can live here, and the neighborhood can vary along with it.\xc2\xa0 Personally, I think the Mission is your best bet. There are some grimier areas, particularly as you go towards Mission Street and east of it, but you have easy access to the highways, you can also take Bart to Millbrae and switch to CalTrain, there are tons of bars and restaurants, and it's reasonably priced.

(Note: the subjective assessment of shadiness used here is my own alone.)Streets deemed shady under both methods (in whole or part):Geary (between Market and Divisadero)MarketVan NessEllisJonesO\'FarrellLarkinPolkTurkMissionGrantFolsom6th StreetLeavenworthGolden GateBasically anywhere in the Tenderloin or southern part of SoMaQualitative Judgments of ShadinessA street may aesthetically appear shady due to the level of deterioration of the buildings; presence of commercial or residential property appearing low in value or devoted to uses associated with cultural out-groups or illicit activity (e.g. check-cashing places or housing projects); absence of residents, pedestrians, and business patrons from socioeconomically privileged groups; police presence; and the presence of individuals whose appearance or behavior indicates they are associated with socioeconomic groups correlated with illicit activity, or who are observably engaging in such behavior. For the purposes of the list given above, my qualitative assessment of a street\'s shadiness is based on "feel," that is, a mental survey of each location employing aesthetic criteria such as those just described.A more systematic qualitative approach might consist of a matrix listing streets on one axis and a set of criteria such as those I described on the other, as shown here:Each street would be scored for each qualitative criterion using a descriptive rubric specifying the characteristics of each rank in a scale. Taking it a step further, subjective judgment could be exercised to determine how heavily to weight each criterion in calculating the overall qualitative shadiness score. However, even when rated systematically, these observable markers perceived as "shady" may or may not be accurate indicators of the incidence of crime.\xc2\xa0 While it is adaptive for individuals to develop accurate perceptions regarding observable characteristics associated with danger, stereotypes and in-group-out-group bias also distort these perceptions (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-...).\xc2\xa0 Visual cues may also be misleading.\xc2\xa0 For example, there is a higher incidence of crime in Cow Hollow and Fisherman\'s Wharf than in the area surrounding the housing projects in the Western Addition, despite the fact that the latter "feels" shadier using the aesthetic criteria described above.An aesthetically-based perception of "shadiness" is therefore highly subjective and is a judgment created in the mind.\xc2\xa0 Such judgments may vary substantially from one individual to another in accordance with differing identities and experiences. Quantitative Judgments of ShadinessGiven the subjectivity of aesthetic judgments, a quantitative approach to assessing shadiness is desirable.\xc2\xa0 A great tool for this is Crimespotting (see: http://sanfrancisco.crimespottin...), where crime report data is mapped on the city and color-coded by category of offense, and the data may be visualized for selected date ranges, hours of the day, etc.\xc2\xa0 If you were arrested for a narcotics crime in San Francisco in the last two weeks, chances are it was in the Tenderloin.\xc2\xa0 If not, it was probably on Mission, Polk/Van Ness, or Haight.\xc2\xa0 Theft is common along Geary, Grant, and Mission, but occurs in a much more broadly diffused incidence pattern across the city than do drug crimes.\xc2\xa0 One problem with this approach is that it may simply select for streets which have the largest volumes of pedestrian traffic.\xc2\xa0 Geary, Van Ness, Market, and Mission are obviously some of the busiest streets in SF, so that likely means more crimes reported even if the crime rates per visitor on those corridors are not proportionally higher than on other streets.A more accurate measure might be an index calculated by taking crime as a percentage of the number of people observed on a street in a given time period (a sort of "per-capita" measure).\xc2\xa0 Such analysis might reveal that per-capita crime on less-populated streets in shady-looking neighborhoods is actually higher than on major streets, making these the shadiest of all.\xc2\xa0 ConclusionThe Tenderloin, Mission, and some parts of SoMa are the shadiest parts of San Francisco, as determined both by crime statistics and subjective perception (no surprise to anyone who has been there).\xc2\xa0 The major arterial roads in those areas may be judged as the shadiest using a non-traffic-adjusted measure of crime incidence, but a proportional measure would probably reveal that less-busy streets in those neighborhoods were even shadier, but simply less frequently observed by pedestrians.\xc2\xa0 This begs the question: if shadiness occurs in an alley and there is no one there to see it, is it shady at all?Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 44, 'answer_user': 'Emily Castor'}, {'answer': "If you had to pick a single street, it would have to be Turk Street.

As a result, if you drive through the Western Addition you will see many of the beautiful old Victorian\'s that typify San Francisco, but you will also see projects that are falling down (the city didn\'t put a lot of money into these public housing projects).\xc2\xa0 More recently, when real estate agents want to sell homes in the "Western Addition," they come up with new and creative names for the neighborhood, since "Western Addition" for many people means "low/moderate income black neighborhood," and lots of potential home-buyers don\'t really want to own a home in a low/moderate income black neighborhood.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So "Nopa" and even portions of "Hayes Valley" have been appropriate for local yuppies.

The mission bay north area is the area north of the channel. It is all built out and quite successful. It includes buildings like The Arterra - 300 Berry - as well as 355 Berry, 325 Berry, 250 and 260 King St. (The Beacon) and numerous rental buildings as well. The southern half of mission bay has been slower to develop. A large chunk of it is UCSF, which is doing quite well, with a large presence already built and in use with the hospital construction moving along at quite a rapid pace. The residential buildings have been slower to come. The first condo building was The Radiance, built by Bosa. They delayed phase 2 which is now being sold as The Madrone -with occupancy expected for later this year. Bosa owns the rights for the other residential condo developments, I\'m sure you\'ll see them break ground once they are close to being done and sold out at The Madrone. There are also a number of rental buildings that have been constructed or are under construction. The remaining pieces of the puzzle are what will happen to the commercial land that was going to be Salesforce.com\'s global HQ, what happens to the port\'s lot that is currently parking for the SF giants, and will a hotel ever commit to building on the space that has been set aside for a hotel. Compared to the railroad yard that it once was, I\'d say that Mission Bay development has been a pretty big success.

If one end of the bridge has less surrounding traffic, or more road space, it makes sense to put the toll on that side. In New York, for instance, the three main accessways into the City from New Jersey all have unidirectional tolls on the New Jersey side. The reason for picking that side becomes very clear if you ever go through the Lincoln tunnel; the traffic buildup caused on the New York side is minimal, at most cramming a couple of nearby streets, but the traffic buildup in Jersey stretches for miles.

The enforcement hours tend to be set to times when the neighborhood is most popular and residents have a hard time parking. In areas with more nightlife, the hours can extend to 9pm or in some places even as late as 10pm.The following justification of residential parking permits was taken from the SFMTA website: http://www.sfmta.com/cms/pperm/i...The preferential residential parking permit (RPP) was established in 1976 to preserve neighborhood living within a major urban center. It is designed to promote the safety, health and welfare of all San Francisco residents by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel, noise and pollution, and by promoting improvements in air quality, convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living, and increased use of public mass transit.

Twitter and the other companies (like mine) that have been encouraged to come to mid-Market will clean up one neighborhood and bring more revenue to the city\'s coffers. In theory, that could help the city address homelessness and the lack of affordable housing. In practice, I doubt San Francisco\'s current mayor and supervisors have the vision, will, and determination to make a noticeable impact on housing and homelessness. These are complex issues where other cities have made real progress. Aside from the insanity of our city\'s political scene, there\'s no good reason why San Francisco can\'t too. Regardless of the short term, improving the city\'s economy will bring voters like me in closer contact with the poor and homeless.

This means that many of the "compassionate" options are gone because the problem has become too large.\xc2\xa0 It also means that some options are closed out - even if SF had more money to hire social workers, there are few affordable places to live near the city - which means SF would need to offer much higher salaries to hire good social workers.\xc2\xa0 Getting rid of industry means few jobs for low skill people who might have a "rough" appearance.

The available facilities were cut in number and the demand on the remaining facilities has been overloaded.At one point, Friedenbach and her team estimated that further cuts or closures would result in 58,000 pounds of human feces on the streets of San Francisco.

You have certainly heard of 6th st. The area between Market and Folsom on 6th street is particularly dangerous. I think that the homeless population is getting a little squeezed into that corridor, which also extends northward over Market into the tenderloin.There are a lot of city services, non-profits and religious organizations that serve the homeless meals in this area, give them donated clothing as well as other services (organizations like this also extend westward down Mission). This makes this a popular place to hang out if you\'re homeless I suppose.Other than the homelessness, Soma is getting nicer at a very rapid pace, there is a lot of new construction just about everywhere in the neighborhood, so I feel it\'ll continue to get better. Soma isn\'t all a cold, concrete jungle, there are areas like South Park, which feel a bit like Hayes Valley. We have great coffee at Blue Bottle, Sight Glass and Vega. We have great restaurants and bars, and plenty of nightclubs if that\'s your speed.One characteristic of Soma is that we don\'t have long stretches of restaurants, or bars.

The 22, 24, and 43 run pretty close to NoPa which hit alot of crosstown neighborhoods that otherwise are somewhat challenging to get to via transit. Downtown San Francisco via the 5L can be a pretty painless ride (assuming Muni isn't having a meltdown). Walk to Golden Gate Park on the weekends, Food + Nightlife: Divisadero is arguably becoming a mini-Valencia street with a combo of great restaurants, old and new bars, and fancy and moderately priced places. The contrast between NoPa on one corner with Popeyes on the other pretty much tells the story of the corridor. Along Divisadero, you can find southern, Indian, Thai, Vegetarian, Mexican, Desert bar and just about anything else within a few blocks. Madrone also provides a nice neighborhood bar by day and a place to get your dance on during weekends and some weeknights. Within the streets of NoPa, there are also other great little coffee shops (Matching Half, others) and corner stores that carry the basics. I almost forgot to mention having the Independent as a local music venue is awesome. Basic Urban Necessities: Within a few blocks, you have a variety of grocery store options with big box Lucky on one end of the neighborhood, and local options like Health Haven and Green Earth, and more artisan and higher-end Bi-Rite (that has a deli and hot food bar) on the other. This is in addition to the Sunday Farmer's Market that is moderately sized, but perfect for the neighborhood. Mojo Bicycle Cafe covers your bike needs, and there are a plethora of carsharing options in the area. Family (and Pet) Friendly: So we're not thinking about having kids just yet, but it's on the horizon. NoPa seems to have lots of young families, and the flat street grid has been host to numerous block parties and Halloween outings that are kid friendly. Not to mention that great parks like Alamo Square, Buena Vista Park and the Panhandle are a few blocks away. The neighborhood association (NOPNA) is more active than most and seems to be doing good things for the neighborhood.Weather: In my experience, Divisadero is roughly the fog line, and living in NoPa, you'll be under the fog much more than the Mission. However, it's more likely that you'll see the sun as compared to your western neighbors.All in all, NoPa is pretty great.

This won't result in existing residents losing their housing, perhaps, but will result in improved safety. (I am not sure if it matters whether said organization is a non-profit or not.

The Mission: This is a hipster, startup, and close to BART line location. It includes many top-notch dive bars and chill spots to hang out. Bring your skateboard, and be ready to listen to some vinyl.2. The Marina: Much trendier, young professional vibe that is a little harder to get back and forth to from SOMA (time consuming). You\'ve got a little more upscale-type bars where a flannel shirt may not always cut it.3. North Beach: This spot has a very traditional San Francisco "feel". You\'re closer to SOMA than in the Marina, yet have a similar demographic and nightlife. This might be the most expensive spot out of the three though.4. The Haight: The Haight has some of the coolest houses you\'ll see in San Francisco. It is also a crossroads of culture. This means all different types of bars, shops, people, etc. The neighborhood is very laid back, and easily accessible for going to SOMA.

I just woke up and it's already rant o'clock?tldr: Fuck SOMA. Go Mission.If your office is anywhere near a BART station, I would STRONGLY recommend against SOMA in favor of the 20-25th St./Valencia-Dolores St. Mission area. In fact, just don't live in SOMA. Let's compare.1. The Mission is relatively safe. My second time in SOMA and my car was broken into (9th and Harrison.) During my friends' visit the week of GDC, their rental car was broken into (4th!!!! and Harrison.) I've heard of people getting mugged. True, the Mission has its fair share of incidents, esp. when you get on Mission St., but the danger level is so much lower compared to SOMA.2. The Mission has some of the best food, coffee, bars in San Francisco. Probably the only area where SOMA has the Mission beat is clubbing with drunk Asian girls. Doesn't sound like that's your thing, but I'm not the one to judge.3. If you value chill bars, the Mission has plenty of those. Make the Liberties at 22nd and Guerrero your neighborhood bar. That place is awesome.4. SOMA residents are comprised of people who can afford to live here (tech industry people) and people who can't (homeless people.) Interesting fact: I'm the CFO of tautology.com. I generally don't find myself talking to SOMA residents, although the service industry people here are just as cool and friendly as other parts of San Francisco. The Mission is much less expensive and therefore attracts an interesting crowd. Like anywhere in the Bay Area, you'll have your tech people, but there's also a fair share of artists, musicians, service industry folk, unemployed trust-fund hipsters, Latinos, teachers, etc. etc. The people here are much friendlier, less on edge, and have great stories to tell. If you value novel human interaction, you will love it in the Mission.5. Mission streets are some of the cleaner ones in San Francisco. It's a stiff competition between SOMA and the Tenderloin for most amount of homeless person feces covering the streets.6. Dolores Park is one of the coolest parks on the planet. There's nothing like kicking back on a sunny Sunday morning with friends at Dolores Park.7. The Mission has slightly, but noticeably, better weather than SOMA. This will ease your transition from the 24/7 Bob Ross painting that is South Bay.Your commute situation does rule out everything north of Market and there are some great neighborhoods up there. You might also want to look into Potrero Hill, which I believe is walking distance to the 16th and Mission BART. Might want to double-check that before you start signing leases.That said, I live in SOMA now for adult reasons. If Caltrain is the only valid form of transportation for you, then yeah you should live in SOMA 4th St. and above. Be prepared to pay exorbitant amounts of money for your place, especially as you get closer to the Caltrain and further from the shit-show that is 6th St.To Paul's credit, things were very different in 2010. Rent is ridiculous now in SOMA and if you're not working for a SOMA start-up, I just don't see how one can justify spending that much.

{'qid': 851, 'ans_num': 7, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85What distinguishes San Francisco from other large US cities?', 'answers': [{'answer': "San Francisco has a unique architectural style. Many buildings date back to the late 19th century, when the city was very prosperous, or the early 20th century, when much of the city was rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake and fire. Architecture in the city draws heavily from both Victorian and Spanish styles, a combination not often found in the United States.Although the city is densely populated, there are relatively few buildings taller than 4-5 stories outside of the Financial District. This contributes to both the city's scenic beauty and its high real estate prices. You can blame this on a combination of hills, earthquake danger, and the negative attitude toward development adopted by San Francisco and California as a whole in the 1970s.The city has a diverse population, drawing migrants from all over the country and around the world. San Francisco has had large Chinese and Mexican populations for a very long time and non-English billboards and street signs are common in certain neighborhoods. Many young people grew up far from San Francisco but came city to work in the tech industry (that, too, contributes to the city's high real estate prices).Do you like fog? San Francisco is located on the Pacific Ocean and is at the mercy of the cold California Current. The weather is dry, cloudy and mild year-round. The warmest and sunniest days actually occur in September and October. During the summer, it can be 65 and foggy in San Francisco while Concord or San Jose is 85 and sunny.Do you like restaurants? San Francisco has a lot of them, and San Francisco residents supposedly spend more per capita on restaurant meals than anyone else in the US. Tourists often cite food as one of their primary reasons to visit the city. California has some of the best produce in the entire world and San Francisco is the best place to eat it.Do you hate children? San Francisco has fewer children than any other US city. It is no coincidence that San Francisco also has one of the largest gay populations of any city in the world (a few other US cities are higher as a percentage of residents, though). Of course, it does not help that real estate is expensive even by California standards. Most people simply can't afford to raise a family in San Francisco.There are a great deal of homeless people milling about. This is due to a combination of nice weather (you're not going to freeze to death sleeping outside in January), the west's status as a destination for people who never really fit in anywhere else, and the city's overall generosity toward the homeless. Despite the fact that the 60s ended a long time ago, Haight-Ashbury continues to be a popular destination for transient hippies and gutter punks.Lastly, San Francisco emerged relatively unscathed from the construction of the interstate highway system. Most planned routes were canceled after the freeway revolts of the 50s and 60s and some freeways were later removed (with some assistance from the Loma Prieta Earthquake).Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 20, 'answer_user': 'Sean Enright'}, {'answer': 'Some thoughts:Staggeringly high rents and property prices.Exceptional numbers of homeless people for such a small area.Population densityGeography - Only Pittsburgh and perhaps Boston have as many hills.Per capita incomeEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 15, 'answer_user': 'Jon Mixon'}, {'answer': "The combination of the natural boundary of its peninsular geography, which, like Manhattan island, produces a dense walking city with good public transit (though not on the scale of New York), and that peninsula's location at the intersection of an ocean and a large bay that is framed by relatively untouched natural headlands and islands, and reached by relatively attractive manmade bridges.

Ha Ra is well-known, mellow and cheap. Koko's is a little more hip yet remarkably unpretentious. Geary Club (a hole in the wall with no sign) is, to me, the pinnacle of a good dive bar, but it's certainly not for everyone.

{'qid': 868, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xc3\xa2\xc2\x98\xc2\x85How much does it cost to open a bar in chicago?', 'answers': [{'answer': "To operate a bar serving hard liquor, you need a Type 47 or 48 license from ABC. Type 47 license means you must serve food along with the liquor (so a restaurant with a bar), and a Type 48 allows you to just serve liquor.Generally, a Type 48 license is hard to come by, and San Francisco is likely out of new ones to give, meaning you have to buy a bar with a license and transfer that license to you. It would probably cost you anywhere from $80k-$300k to buy the business depending on how much business it was doing already, its location, and its lease on the building/space. Once you buy the business, rent might be anywhere from $2-$5 or even more per square foot. So a 1000 sq ft space will run you as much as $5000/month for rent -- so $60,000 per year.Employees get at least minimum wage -- $10 in SF plus taxes and benefits. Assume perhaps $12-$15/hr for each employee.Liquor has about 80-90% margin. Beer and Wine has about 50-75% margin.Insurance might be a few thousand dollars per year. Also have to consider an entertainment permit, noise permit, health-care fee in SF, which I don't know what the rate is at this time.Given that you want at least 3-years of cash to establish your business, you probably want to have about $400,000-600,000 to buy and operate the bar before jumping in.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Nico Tuason'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 1, 13, 21, 45), 'tag': ['Dive Bars', 'Bartending', 'Sports Bars', 'Bars in San Francisco', 'Bars'], 'question_user': "Brian O'Neill"}
{'qid': 869, 'ans_num': 4, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85What are the best places to stay and eat if someone is traveling up the coast from Monterey to San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': "The way I see it, you have four major stops to make from how you describe your trip in the question and comments. Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Francisco and Napa. Monterey - I stayed in the Hotel Pacific a few years ago and really enjoyed it. It's an affordable all-suite hotel that's a little on the old side but has some character. It's also located near Cannery Row and the aquarium, which makes touring very easy. http://www.hotelpacific.com/I recommend stopping by the bar at the Clement Hotel, just down the street from the aquarium, and having one or more of their affordable champagne flights. http://www.yelp.com/biz/c-restau... Also check out Hula's Island Grill for one of the better dinners in town and some fantastic tiki-style drinks. http://www.yelp.com/biz/hulas-is... On your drive north up Highway 1, I recommend Phil's Fish Market and Eatery for lunch or dinner. http://www.yelp.com/biz/phils-fi...Santa Cruz - I used to live here and when I've stayed in hotels I've stayed in cheap ones close to downtown. Pacific Ave is the main drag and, in my opinion, the best walking street in Northern California. Great shopping and people watching during the day and a vibrant bar scene at night (though dominated by the town's massive college population). Have breakfast at Brazil if you can find the time. There's usually a long wait for a table but it's worth it. http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-bra...Head down to the wharf for a seafood dinner. These aren't the best restaurants around, but they're certainly not bad and I like it for the atmosphere. There's usually some sea lions hanging out on the rafters under the wharf and on a clear day the views are fantastic. I recommend Riva's. http://www.yelp.com/biz/riva-fis...Check out the Boardwalk if that interests you. Check to see if there's a show you might like at the Catalyst, the best music venue in town. There are tons of gorgeous beach spots to check out in and around Santa Cruz, with Natural Bridges being the most famous. Driving and walking around the breathtaking UCSC campus is also worth your time. Continue up Highway 1. Others may be able to recommend some nice stops in Half Moon Bay or Pacifica. San Francisco - Major city and global tourist destination, so I'll spare you the ten page write-up. Ask me if you want some specific recommendations. Your car will be a liability here, so you may want to get a hotel downtown with parking so you can store your car. Oct 5-7 is the free Hardly Strictly Bluegrass music festival in Golden Gate Park. Oct 4-8 is Fleet Week. Look into these if you'll be in town during those days. Oct 7 is the Italian Heritage parade in North Beach. Napa/Sonoma - I don't have a lot to say on California's wine country. Personally, I've never understood the combination of drinking and driving that's normally required to experience the area. I'm sure others can offer recommendations.Embed QuoteVia  Bill McDonald.Suggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Phil DiNuzzo'}, {'answer': "I think two of your best bets are just south of Monterey and just north of San Francisco - if you have time, you should stay in Carmel - there are tons of cute bed and breakfasts there.

In San Francisco, you have a million options - just stay near Union Square/Embarcadero. Finally, you should head north and check out Sausalito/Tiburon and get up to Sonoma if you can (I prefer it to Napa). I love staying at the Sonoma Mission Inn.

Eat at Passionfish in Monterey for a bit of a splurge. Even if fish isn't your thing, they have other things (like a certain chanterelle mushroom risotto I recall, with local, wild chanterelles) that are over the top. Stop at Swanton Berry Farm. They have an honor till and food inside, my favorites being their strawberry shortcake and hot strawberry apple cider. Enjoy them at a picnic table while you stare at the ocean.Don't miss Mercado & Taqueria De Amigos in Pescadero. Yes, it's in a filling station, but trust me on this one.Stay at Costanoa in Pescadero. It has a very good restaurant and a variety of price points, as there's a KOA there. A fun, very California thing to do is to time your trip for a third Saturday of the month so you can do a work day, potluck dinner, and barn dance at Pie Ranch. The 3-Zero Cafe at the Half Moon Bay airport makes a really good breakfast, but the highlight is their coffee, friendly service, and watching all kinds of crazy, experimental little airplanes land and take off right beside you. Definitely a unique ambiance. Though it's south of Monterey, if you should somehow end up on PCH in this direction, Big Sur Bakery is fantastic.

{'qid': 878, 'ans_num': 1, 'question': '\xc3\xa2\xc2\x98\xc2\x85How can one buy a liquor license in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'DISCLAIMER: This is ABSOLUTELY NOT legal advice and I am NOT an expert in liquor licenses. My only qualification is my having done research on this in the recent past. Please, please talk to an expert before taking any of what I say as an absolute fact.-------------------------------------So the first thing you are going to want to do is figure out what type of license you need. In order to determine this you will need to know exactly how the beer club would operate: would it be tied to an actual physical location, open to the public? Would people be allowed to drink inside/on premises? Or will it be simply a "ship to your house" type of thing? These questions and more will effect what type of liquor license you need.The California ABC website keeps a list of all of the different license types[0]. The most common types of licenses (as far as I know) are 21, 47, and 48, which are generally tied to liquor stores, restaurants, and bars, respectively. Assuming your friend will only be dealing in beer, and depending on the answers to the questions I posed earlier, you may want to look more into types 20, 40, 61, or possible even 17. The ABC also maintains an list explaining the privileges of each type[1] (the list is incomplete but hits the most common types). If you are of the legalese-inclined, you may also want to read article XX section 22 of the state constitution[2], and cross-reference some of the definitions included in the descriptions of the license types with division 9 of the Alcoholic Beverage Act[3]. You will almost certainly want to talk to a lawyer or expert in these matters, because getting the wrong license is going to be an expensive mistake.Once you\'ve determined what license type you will need to get, you should try and find out if there are restrictions on the number of those licenses allowed in the county. For example, off-sale (not to be drunk on premises) beer and wine licenses are limited to one for each 2,500 people in a county*. If the type of license you need is not currently being issued by the ABC due to limits, then you will have to buy one from someone else. There are a number of websites and broker services that can help pair you up with someone selling a license[4, e.g.], but it will be very costly.You then just have to fill out a whole boatload of forms downloadable from the ABC website, schedule an appointment, and file your application! Depending on the type, again, the ABC may ask you to do a number of things including putting an ad in the newspaper, posting a sign on the door, or waiting for a public comment period to expire. But hey, at least it\'s out of your hands now!If the ABC accepts your application, hooray! You have, I believe, 30 days to start using the license, so get to work! If you\'re opening a public place, you did remember to get your necessary SFPD permits in order, right? There are a whole slew of them you may need!That\'s about as much information as I can provide. Getting a liquor license is a great example of an unnecessarily complex government process, one that is made so much easier if you hire a lawyer or expert to handle it for you. Good luck however you decide!---------------------------------------------------* There\'s also a dependency between off-sale beer and wine licenses and off-sale general licenses in that the total in a county cannot be more than 1 for every 1,250 people.[0] http://www.abc.ca.gov/permits/li...[1] http://abc.ca.gov/forms/abc616.pdf[2] http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const...[3] http://abc.ca.gov/forms/ABCAct_2...[4] http://ca.liquorlicenseconnectio...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Doug Horn'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 10, 10, 8, 42), 'tag': ['Liquor Licenses', 'Bars in San Francisco', 'Local Government', 'Liquor and Spirits', 'Beer', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Anonymous User'}

{'qid': 880, 'ans_num': 6, 'question': "\xe2\x98\x85What's a good bar in SF for a bootstrapped startup to throw a launch party on the cheap?", 'answers': [{'answer': "Actually, more often than not, venues in San Francisco will give you the space for free if you can guarantee a minimum amount of people (the amount differs on the venue) or guarantee a minimum in liquor sales (the amount differs depending on the night as well as on the venue). In fact, this works even better if you throw a party on a traditionally slow night (ie \xe2\x80\x93 Sunday, Monday or Tuesday). I would definitely recommend not throwing a party any place where you have to pay for the space since you're bringing them liquor sales for the evening without them having to lift a finger. Keep in mind, party promoters get paid by venues to perform essentially the same function.The first thing to do if you're looking for specific venues is to figure out roughly how many people you expect to show up; that will determine the venue you should go with. If you're going for under 75 people that will change your options versus having a launch party with over 150 people. Here are some venues to look at (I put in venues of different sizes because I don't know what you're looking for):* Oz Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/oz-loung...) \xe2\x80\x93 They only serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They do not serve shots. Their capacity is about 60 people and they have excellent food if you want to class it up for cheap. This is more of a lounge vibe. If you ask them nicely, they'll even get a jazz band to play for your party for cheap. Or they can also bring in a DJ.* Sugar Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-ca...) \xe2\x80\x93 They have a full bar and will serve all kinds of liquor. They also have two different closed off areas for private parties, if you'd like. They also serve excellent food and if you get the whole place to yourself their capacity is about 150 (but I wouldn't go over 100 with them otherwise things can get uncomfortable at the bar). They don't have a license for live music, so they play music off an iPod (you can bring in your own if you want them to use that). This is also a lounge vibe.* The Cellar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cell...) \xe2\x80\x93 This is right next door to Sugar and it's more of a club vibe than a lounge vibe. They have two different rooms and their capacity can easily hit about 200 (comfortably). With their recent renovations it's gotten really classy, but the drinks are still really cheap. They have two rooms and they are often willing to give you the smaller room (~50 person capacity) if you just want that.* Mah-velous (http://sfluxe.com/2010/11/03/sim...) \xe2\x80\x93 These guys are so new they don't even have a Yelp page yet, but they are actively looking to get the word out about themselves. They're strictly a coffee and wine bar and their capacity is comfortably about 30; but it's a dope little venue. For a wine bar, their prices are pretty inexpensive. If you're looking for a smaller launch party, but classy (and relatively inexpensive), this could be an option.* Blur (http://www.yelp.com/biz/blur-san...) \xe2\x80\x93 This is a nice little bar on Polk Street. They have a full bar and their bartenders are really cool. They have a comfortable capacity of about 60, but it's a really cool spot.* Impala (http://www.yelp.com/biz/impala-s...) \xe2\x80\x93 While the Yelp reviews are mediocre, it's under new ownership as of December and the new guy is really working on making some serious changes. If you're going to throw a party there you can get the downstairs/VIP room to yourself and it comfortably fits about 100 people. They also have one of the best bartenders in the city (he's a trained mixologist). They serve some pretty solid Mexican food and they can make some stuff for your party as well.* The Parlor (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-parl...) \xe2\x80\x93 This place has been doing a good job of reaching out to tech companies in recent days, so I'd take a look at it. It's in Fisherman's Wharf, but don't let that stop you. They have three full bars in the venue and they can fit well over 300 people comfortably.Ok. I'm going to stop writing a book now.

Not good if you want multiple rooms or projector though, but with a group that\'s only 150 you might want a place that feels a little cozier than getting too spread out. Box SF is literally just an "event space." It\'s beautiful, but is pricey, has a lot of build outs and customizations that need to take place. But it is targeted exactly for that business size.The best deal I\'ve found is House of Shields on New Montgomery just across from the Palace Hotel. Lots of character (think speakeasy style). Very accommodating. Excellent business to work with. And they\'ll do an open bar without liquor restrictions. They\'ll help you customize a branded menu. And they do their own catering of pretty delicious appetizers.

I think August Capital had a party there. Other grand historic rooms include the City Club (www.cityclubsf.com) and my favorite, the Julia Morgan Ballroom (julia morgan ballroom). The Marines Memorial has a beautiful room up top (please forgive their cheesy pictures www.marineclub.com/groups.php).Some other high places with views - you can rent out the Top of the Mark (www.intercontinentalmarkhopkins.com/top_of_the_mark/) or the Starlight Room (www.harrydenton.com/index.php?page=private). The most spectacular is probably the top floor ballroom at the St. Francis (skip the lower floor ballrooms) - www.westinstfrancis.com/weddings-social-events/.Terra Gallery (that's where the first SF Quora user party was last year). I'm only so-so on this one, as it takes a lot of work to decorate it nicelyYerba Buena Center for the Arts - Yelp had its Christmas party there once. http://www.ybca.org/rentals/venu....SF Moma, the convention room www.sfmoma.org/about/facility_rentals/facility_rentals_policies. Museums can be cool... you could do it at the California Academy and party under the dinosaurs, www.calacademy.org/visit/plan_an_event/.If you want to be extra classy, the St. Regis and the Intercontinental (the Convention Center one, not the Mark Hopkins) both do parties very well.\xc2\xa0 For a different vibe consider Clift Hotel. When you do it at a hotel you can rent a hospitality suite upstairs for an afterparty / private reception room kind of thing, and also rooms for any visiting investors, dignitaries, etc. Some hotels like the Westin or Four Seasons can do an outdoor tent, which is kind of fun.A number of nightclubs are in that size range: Infusion Lounge (http://infusionlounge.com/), Slide (http://slidesf.com/), Temple (www.templesf.com/), Mezzanine (www.mezzaninesf.com/private_events.asp), Slim's (www.slims-sf.com/fr-PrivateEvents.html), DNA Lounge (www.dnalounge.com/booking/)Ruby Skye - may be too big, http://www.rubyskye.com/index1.h...111 Minna is a classic.

The venue is not bare. There is constantly shifting art displayed (unlike Mezzanine or Mighty)4. They also have several projectors available for use5.

{'qid': 911, 'ans_num': 9, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85Why is it so hard for nightclubs and bars to stay in business?', 'answers': [{'answer': '<\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94Aunt has owned and run nightclubs and bars for decadesNIghtclub trends shift quickly.\xc2\xa0 Very quickly.\xc2\xa0 People are picky and always want to be at the newest and "hottest" location.\xc2\xa0 This requires a club to constantly innovate (which they don\'t), constantly re-brand, remodel and shift direction (most don\'t or can\'t).\xc2\xa0 Because people are always looking for something new, once a club gets established, the "trend setters" will have typically moved on to someplace new.\xc2\xa0 This, in turn, causes the club to have to heavily invest money in the next point.Promoting the club.  About six years ago, my Aunt and her boyfriend owned one of the most popular clubs that catered to Cleveland\'s "elite" black community.\xc2\xa0 Cleveland is a big city and contrary to popular myth, most black folks are middle class and are completely under-served as a demographic when it comes to nightclubs (the ethics and/or social impact of focusing in a race can be debated another time).\xc2\xa0 Anyway, her nightclub was located in the key nightlife area of Cleveland (the Warehouse District).\xc2\xa0 The first year it was opened, they would have to turn people away after having the doors open for 30 minutes.\xc2\xa0 Each year that tapered off.\xc2\xa0 Eventually they had to invest massive sums of money in promoting the club and investing in gimmicks.\xc2\xa0 This included paying people like Shaq or Lebron or Cribs to come and sit in the VIP lounge with their friends and party, essentially, for free just so people would come and play there.\xc2\xa0 You cannot possibly imagine the bar tabs these people would run up.\xc2\xa0 Promoters demanded half of the cover charge and free drinks for their crew. The gimmicks ended up gobbling up the whole profit of even being open.\xc2\xa0 Two years ago they closed the club (again) and sold it to reopen a new club right down the street.\xc2\xa0 This is a common trend in clubs that cannot or do not develop a passionate following.\xc2\xa0 Wear and tear on a club is insane.  Let me reiterate:\xc2\xa0 It\'s fucking insane.\xc2\xa0 When I was working for my aunt as VIP service host (oh the stories I could tell you), we were replacing leather bunkers (bench booths) weekly.\xc2\xa0 They\'d be ripped.\xc2\xa0 We had to replace the carpeting in the VIP lounge every few months.\xc2\xa0 We\'d have to fully extract the carpets weekly.\xc2\xa0 Glassware, tables, chairs, equipment all gets heavily used and destroyed because partying people tend to be rough on everything.Theft for many clubs may be an issue, but not here.\xc2\xa0 They had Fort Knox level security.\xc2\xa0 Cameras on every register.\xc2\xa0 Meters on all drink pourers.\xc2\xa0 A set number of comps each could give out a night.\xc2\xa0 But many clubs don\'t invest in these things and watch their profits go up in smoke due to employee theft and freebies (to make better tips).Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 98, 'answer_user': 'Dan Holliday'}, {'answer': 'The biggest problem seems to be employee theft. Even when the employees don\'t realize they are stealing, they often are. When they overpour your drink hoping for a bigger tip, they are selling you the bar\'s liquor and putting the money in their own pocket. It\'s rare for Jon Taffer to go into a bar on his show and not find inventory issues. "You stole more than the bar sold last night" or "You gave away more than the bar sold last night" is a commonly heard phrase.Employee training is also a huge issue. Anything more complicated than opening a beer bottle requires the bartender to know what they are doing. Seems like a lot of them really don\'t know how to make a good drink or pour a beer correctly.One that I found interesting was over serving. If your business model is serving really strong drinks, you probably won\'t last long even if you charge appropriately. Nobody likes to be around really drunk people, except other really drunk people, and spending slows way down, even stops, once people get really drunk. Not having food. No food means people have to leave when they get hungry, and people who leave probably won\'t be back that night. Nightclub owners seem to think they are just running a bar with a dance floor, when what they need to have is a destination.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 50, 'answer_user': 'Matt Wasserman'}, {'answer': "In my experience, the following is almost always the case with nightclubs and bars that close relatively soon after opening:They are under-capitalized -  The owners didn't bother to determine a sizable enough amount of capital beyond what they would need to initially open the doors and they always end up with cash flow problems within a few months.The owners were woefully inexperienced. While some had worked at nightclubs, almost none had ever worked as the manager of a successful club and almost every night was a learning experience (that wasn't a good thing).The owners had a poor relationship with the police. If the police are constantly called to your nightclub or bar, the police administration will go to either the board that controls liquor licenses in your municipality or put pressure on the city business licensing bureau for you to close down. While I'm not saying that the police should be given free drinks, keeping at least a neutral relationship with them (since you are going to require their assistance) and keeping your internal problems to a minimum, will help keep your business open for an extended period of time.Employee problems, especially theft. Basically, most of the people that you're going to employ in a nightclub or a bar are frankly, marginal people. They call in frequently, or they just don't show. Sometimes they steal. And they use or sell drugs. Unless you are exceptionally skilled at handling such marginal people in workplace environments, it can quickly become overwhelming and cause you a great deal of personal stress thus affecting your business judgment.Poor planning. This differs from #2. Rather than researching your market to see if the market could bear an additional nightclub or if simply buying into an existing nightclub would be a better business opportunity, most people simply decide to open a club and see what happens. Unfortunately, because they didn't do any type of market research what usually happens is, there is an initial rush because of the newness of the club, followed up by a steep drop-off in business and a quick closure.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 88, 'answer_user': 'Jon Mixon'}, {'answer': "High long-term fixed costs, relatively low barriers to entry and very high delta with respect to what's currently culturally en vogue.

He didn\'t typically "hang out" in The City when I was around. He was backstage and onstage at Keystone Berkeley a lot, and I was there whenever he was and plenty of times he was not; ditto me being near during his years of playing all sorts of venues on the road in No and So Cal. I was a little bit too young to have been hanging out with all of them including Janis, Airplane, et all in that crazy house they all stayed in on the north side of the Panhandle. I remember being around him later on in San Rafael, near a river -- I have no idea what river it was. I remember kaleidoscopic images of dried brush, hot summer days and nights, sangria and picnics, JG walking down the sloping hill, on a diagonal away from me, toward the banks of the river with his arm around a woman with long brown hair (his wife), his and other children dancing to music.Later I remember a huge warehouse where everybody played / practiced (this was around 1976, I was seeing their sound mixer, and this was just around the time I was considering whether I was going to go to law school so I could protect the property rights of musicians, singers and songwriters -- see below). ... and best of all I remember a time later on from that era (1975? I\'m not good with dates) when the Allman Brothers needed someone to substitute for Greg Allman while Greg was away from his band reportedly doing jail time for heroin. There was a Warner Brothers party (the record label of the Allman Brothers) to welcome someone playing lead -- Les Dudek? -- and that night, at a club in San Rafael, (or maybe it was San Anselmo?) on the same stage, were Steve Miller, Eric Clapton, Merle Saunders, Donna Godchaux, JG, Bob Weir, and I forget who else. It was unforgettable even though I can\'t remember all of it, and you can read this answer to see why I\'m so hazy on the details here: Why does my boyfriend always tell me "you\'re pretty when you\'re quiet" whenever I try to ask him a question?But the time that most impressed me was the first time I ever met him. He was playing Dark Star in Laguna Beach on the deck of a beachhouse, well into the dark of night, waves crashing. I never forgot the experiences of that night, in 1968.After graduating from law school I went to the legal department of MCA Records. I was hired away from MCA by Dead lawyer Hal Kant, and he invited me to work at his firm, Kant & Starr. I did that because he was the Dead\'s lawyer, because he was the smartest man I ever met, and because he had Peter Max original lithographs covering every inch of every wall of his entire law firm.Embed QuoteVia  Dallas Schorfhaar.Suggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Nan Waldman'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 15, 18, 34), 'tag': ['Jerry Garcia', 'Grateful Dead (band)', 'Bars in San Francisco', 'Restaurants in San Francisco', 'San Francisco'], 'question_user': 'Brad Griffith'}

When people look around for inexpensive event venues - and assuming a standard cocktail reception-style format - I usually steer them toward either bars and lounges with low minimums or interesting rental spaces where you can bring in a separate catering service for a cash bar (so your guests pay for refreshments, rather than you as the host!)A couple of suggestions to give you an idea of available options:Swig is a sleek bar in the Tenderloin district with an intimate, unique private area overlooking the rest of the space. You can rent out the Loft & Penthouse (capacity: 55) for a $1000 minimum for a late evening event - 9:00PM until close.http://venuetastic.com/venues/sw...Miette is a pastry shop located in the Ferry Building, and if you\'d like to give your guests a bit of a different experience (or perhaps your guests aren\'t the standard cocktail-drinking sort?), you can rent out their space (capacity: only 25, but worth considering as an example of the many non-standard venues around San Francisco) for a flat fee on weekday mornings or weekend evenings.http://venuetastic.com/venues/mi...Otis is an intimate lounge with a really unique atmosphere and a very responsive events staff.

This is my own ranking based on convenience for driving, parking, accessibility, nightlife and how the commute is.1) SOMA - The nice parts to live in are south of Harrison and between 2nd and 5th. Areas between 5th and 10th get a little sketchier with the amount of homeless shelters and dimly lit streets in the area. SOMA has easy access to 280 if you're driving. From most parts of SOMA, you can walk to the Caltrain station pretty easily. Parking is okay, but most condos have a place for you to rent a spot for $150-300/month. The Avalon apartment complexes are pretty much full of young professionals in their 20s. Not too much local nightlife other than 330 Ritch. But it's easy to catch a cab and get to any part of the city for $7-$15.2) Mission - Very lively; you can walk anywhere and everywhere and find bars and restaurants. Dolores Park on summer weekends is awesome and there are tons of bars and lounges around: 16th and Guerrero, Valencia, and Mission between 18th and 22nd. Stay away from the 16th/Mission and 24th/Mission Bart Stations. It's as the Brits would say, dodgy, at times. Also, there's known to be a few muggings and robberies targeting Google and Apple shuttle commuters. Parking here is okay, but I recommend parking west (or up the hill) of Valencia, the closer you get to Mission the greater likelihood your car will be broken-in to.3) Russian Hill/Nob Hill - Great area, very safe (more so Russian Hill). Tons of bars up and down Polk Street for a mile until you reach the Tenderloin/Civic Center. Parking is horrendous though and requires a city permit if you want to leave your car there during the day. I used to spend on average of 10-20 minutes to find parking and I would consider 5 blocks away as close. The drive to the freeway in the morning isn't bad -- just take either Polk or Gough straight to the 101/280. Restaurants are in the $$$ range but all 4 star+ no matter what guide you use. The restaurants in the Russian Hill area are more candle lit date spots than a place to grab a bite with your buddies.4) Noe Valley - I live here now. Parking is easy, the 280 entrance is right around the corner. But not much to do in regards to 21+ scene. Mostly newlyweds and new parents in the area. The Mission and Castro are close, but they're not quite walking distance due to all the hills.Other notes: Also, this is a funny cartoon to get the general sense of the people by neighborhood. San Francisco Neighborhood map by Bikes (http://sconnolly.net/wp-content/...)Marina and North Beach are great areas but it's tough to commute to Mountain View. They are the farthest from 101/280.Richmond and Sunset areas are highly residential, though with lots of good Asian food in those areas.

Not only is it a quick walk to the train in the morning, but in the evening you can always catch a cab at the train station to get you anywhere else in the city you might want to go. You\'re also right at the ramp to 280 if you do want to/have to drive.If you\'re going to be driving, something out in the Mission close to Valencia between, say, 16th and Cesar Chavez is going to put you close to the freeways and within walking distance to lots of "hip" nightlife and would likely be a bit less expensive.There\'s no way in heck that I\'d put myself in the position of having to take Muni or BART to get to Caltrain on a daily basis. Caltrain from SF to MV is 45-60min depending on whether you\'re on a "local" or "baby bullet" (i.e. "express"), and relying on any other form of public transit to get to/from Caltrain\'s going to give you a 1.5hr (good day) to 2hr (bad day) commute.

Ride through Golden Gate Park to Ocean Beach. Ride over Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito and/or Tiburon and take a ferry back. (P.S. Ferries are cheaper if you load money on a Clipper card.) If you're up for something a little more strenuous, ride the Butterlap. Bay Area Bike Share launches later this month!Walk everywhere. San Francisco is full of hills and views and secret stairways and hidden gems. Walk up Bernal Hill and take in the best view of San Francisco. And there's Billy Goat Hill and Corona Heights and Telegraph Hill and so many more. Try Adah Bakalinsky's Stairway Walks in San Francisco for a bunch of great planned walks, as well as its East Bay counterpart.Go to parks. Parks are free! Dolores Park is where the hip youth hang out; bring a blanket to sit on, a sack lunch, and a tall boy in a brown bag. There's also Alamo Square Park and Precita Park and Duboce Park and so many more.Golden Gate Park is massive so it gets its own bullet point. Bike here, bike through it. There are gardens and ponds and waterfalls and roaming bison (really!) and an angler's pool. There's the Conservatory of Flowers. There's a gorgeous Japanese garden that is free between 9-10am. And there are museums: the de Young art museum, the California Academy of Sciences. Museum admissions are pricey, but the de Young observation deck is free, as is the sculpture garden, which contains one of my favorite San Francisco secrets: James Turrell's Three Gems skyscape. Go find it.Eat Mission burritos. They're huge (1.5 to 2 meals each), cheap (usually between $4-7 each) and delicious. Or eat tacos if you have a smaller appetite; they're cheaper, too. Try Taqueria Cancun (burritos), Taqueria la Vallarta (tacos), El Farolito (both).Check out lists like this and this (and lots of others on that page's sidebar) for other cheap eats. Keep in mind that this city changes very quickly and some lists might be outdated, so do your research; a quick Yelp search should suffice.Amnesia has free live music on Mondays and Wednesdays; Revolution Cafe and the Rite Spot both have free live music practically every night. Check their respective calendars, and don't be shy about talking to musicians and asking what other affordable shows to check out - there are so many secret/spur-of-the moment shows everywhere.Go to dive bars and get boozed for cheap. My favorites include Bender's, the Attic, El Rio, Thee Parkside, the Knockout, the Makeout Room, the Lone Palm, Tunnel Top, and more. Take advantage of happy hour specials (often $2 beers and $3 wells and shot/beer specials).

surcharge on rides out of SFO to destinations more than 15 miles away.\xc2\xa0 If you value your time at say $1/minute, then you can still break even in terms of money and still be ahead in terms of time (compared to other strategies), even if you were to take up to 45 minutes to find someone to split a cab.\xc2\xa0 Unless it's really early in the morning or really late in the evening, there will surely be someone headed to Palo Alto in that time.\xc2\xa0 Plus, serendipity might cross your path with interesting people.The $45 savings is pretty high, so any cost-conscious traveler will likely split a cab with you.\xc2\xa0 Even if the traveler will get a business reimbursement, he or she still might enjoy some friendly conversation on the ride, and if the conversation were to get awkward, there's only 20 minutes of it anyways.Anecdotally, I tried this on a Monday around noon-time and was able to find someone headed to downtown Palo Alto after asking around 10 people for about 10 minutes, so I was able to get back to Palo Alto in a little over 30 min for $30 (the fellow traveler offered to cover more because he would get reimbursed by his company).\xc2\xa0 The traveler shared a story about his friend in Korea who made a fortune on a Q&A site where people asked to have their fortunes told.Close UpdateLink to Questions, Topics, Blogs and People ://TExplain Your

way.\xc2\xa0 There are lots of bad ways listed here.\xc2\xa0 For public transportation http://511.org does a good job at mapping out routes.Some of the Palo Alto Cabs are sizably cheaper than the SF cabs. The Yellow Cab below quotes $65 to/from SFO ( http://www.call4cab.com/rates.html ).\xc2\xa0 You can call when you land and in about 20-30 minutes they'll be at SFO - about the time it takes to taxi, deplane and get to the curb.BART/Caltrain is almost always the slowest method (511.org will confirm this) other than walking.The KX bus is the best cheap option.\xc2\xa0 Faster\xc2\xa0 than BART/Caltrain (beats BART/Caltrain by 15 minutes usually) and one quarter the cost.\xc2\xa0 It is a local bus and makes lots of stops.\xc2\xa0 But it is the best public transportation option.\xc2\xa0 http://www.samtrans.com/schedule...Supershuttle and the like are reasonable options at about $28 each way.\xc2\xa0 Anyone who travels regularly will have had bad experiences with them (being late for a pickup or endlessly circling SFO).I personally find driving and parking in longterm parking the best option. I'll do this for trips up to 10 days (about what round trip taxis would cost).\xc2\xa0 The drive is 20-25 minutes and with both US101 and I280 available, traffic is rarely a problem.There really should be an airport express bus running up El Camino Real that only picks up going to SFO and only drops off coming back from SFO and runs $5 to $10, takes 40 minutes and is relatively comfortable.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 10, 'answer_user': 'Jay Wacker'}, {'answer': "There are a few options here:1/ Cab ($85ish).\xc2\xa0 By far the fastest and most flexible.2/ Drive and Park ($14/day).\xc2\xa0 I usually do this for weekend trips since the cost isn't too much, and I avoid imposing on other people.3/ Caltrain -> BART ($10) -> SFO.\xc2\xa0 Pretty slow, especially coming back from the airport if you have to wait on Caltrain at Millbrae.4/ KX bus ($2, I think).\xc2\xa0 I've never tried it personally, but I hear it's pretty reasonable but slow.5/ Walking (free).\xc2\xa0 I think Peter Kravtsov tried this once.I do a combination of the first three based on how lazy I feel and how long I'll be gone (more than a few days generally rules out driving and parking).Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 25, 'answer_user': 'Justin Mitchell'}, {'answer': "I almost always take a hybrid approach: take a taxi from SFO to Millbrae, then take the Caltrain from Millbrae.

There is really no good answer to this question. Around the globe locations have tried to reproduce "Silicon Valley" by proclaiming their own "<our place> Valley" as if an initiative and a rename is all it takes. Silicon Valley is all about tons of people who are very experienced in risk / reward analysis and who realize that failure is highly likely but success can be monsterous. There is no physical place to visit where you can absorb the skills and attitudes that are pervasive here. What many do is to visit the campuses of big name Silicon Valley companies and all you will see is big office buildings, just like anywhere else. The best advice I can give you is to schedule a ton of meetings with anyone you have a connection to that deals with startups; bankers, lawyers, accountants, engineers, artists, CEOs, VCs, Angel investors, anyone who is willing to exchange a nice meal and time to tell you about their experiences. What you seek is our experiences, how we view the world. What you probably desire is that all the people in your locale would play the Silicon Valley game to support your efforts.

{'qid': 981, 'ans_num': 4, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85What things are considered touristy in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': "1. Fisherman's Wharf / Pier 39-This is probably the most famous tourist trap in SF. It's filled with out of towners, the food is terrible, the stores are useless, and it's devoid of any redeeming qualities other than the nearby In N Out. In summary, Pier 39 makes the Mos Eisley cantina look like the palace of Versailles.2. Lombard Street-You can see the line to drive down the twisty part of Lombard Street on any given weekend. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lom.... I don't know of any SFers that take the time to do this, as there's always a wait, and most SF residents have seen it at some point. Lombard Street is cool, but in my opinion it's not worth the hassle after the first time you've seen it.3. Ferry Building-This is the case particularly on Saturdays, when the Farmer's Market is in town. Even though it is clogged with people, I would argue this is one of the few pleasant places in SF that is filled with tourists, as the food is excellent, and on a nice day it's great to be outside near the water. Many locals go here, as the produce is truly fantastic, but it attracts tons of tourists.4. Chinatown-There is a sizable native population, but there are also tons of tourists that come through strictly for the gawking. I've never understood why this is pitched as a tourist attraction, as I don't find Chinatown to be very pleasant, but nonetheless, somehow it has become a tour guide staple.5. Union Square-Like some of the aforementioned locations, there are lots of local SF residents who frequent Union Square in addition to the non-natives, as it has more / better shopping than any other neighborhood in San Francisco, with stores like Barneys, Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Levi's, Niketown, etc. Within Union Square, The Cheesecake Factory at the top of Macy's is Ground Zero for tourists, and is to be avoided at all costs.6. Golden Gate Bridge-This applies to the people who are walking across the bridge, and exploring the small hiking area on the Marin side. Tons of SF residents use the bridge to travel to and from various spots in Marin and further up north, but on any given weekend you'll see tourists crossing the bridge by foot or bike, and exploring the surrounding areas and vantage points.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 14, 'answer_user': 'Henry P Knapp'}, {'answer': "Let's not forget those ridiculous land/water vehicles with the open roofs that drive around the city and then straight into the water (the Duck Tours) http://www.sanfranciscotours.us/...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Andy Anderson'}, {'answer': 'Cable car (+1 if it has tires)AlcatrazGhiradelli SquareCoit TowerPalace of Fine ArtsEmbed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Dian Tjandrawinata'}, {'answer': 'Golden Gate, Alcatraz Island, China Town, Lombard Street, Coit Tower and more.

A ton of ideas to help you plan an epic weekend in San Francisco.Take your date sailing on a catamaran under the Golden Gate Bridge. I recommend Adventure Cat - they have extremely affordable tickets. Trouble Coffee! Here\'s the thing to do. Buy a coconut. Buy a cappuccino. Buy a Texas French cinnamon toast. Then, take a bite of the toast, followed by a sip of cappuccino, followed by a sip of fresh coconut water. It\'s amazing. Grab a bottle of Bruce Cost\'s Ginger Ale and a fresh peach at Bi-Rite Grocery. Head towards Dolores Park on a sunny Saturday afternoon and plant yourself at the corner of 20th & Church Street where you can sit, enjoy your drink, and contemplate life as you take in some of the most gorgeous and relaxing views of the city. Buy a cigar at Grant\'s Tobacconist. Walk up Nob Hill from California Ave and when you reach the classy Huntington Park, light it up and enjoy while sitting on a bench in front of the fountain. Then check out Grace Cathedral next door and the side-courtyard with the fountain.Take your date and walk up to Russian Hill Place (Vallejo St. & Florence St.) and check out the lovely mansions and their manicured gardens. Walk all the way to the end of the Cul De Sac, stand on the balcony, and take in the views. Then peek around the corner and go down the staircase - you\'ll see even more houses and gardens. Keep going through Ina Coolbirth Park until you reach Vallejo St. Grab dinner in Chinatown or Little Italy - whichever strikes your fancy.Continue through Vallejo until you see Caffe Trieste (Vallejo & Grant) - my favorite North Beach Cafe. If you make it here on a Saturday afternoon you\'ll run into an Italian instrumental and operatic performance. If you\'re in SOMA, check out South Park. It\'s a cozy, quiet alcove filled with lovely trees and benches. Perfect place to have a weekday lunch. Grab an espresso at Caffe Centro and walk around the oval. This park is famous for all the start-ups that originated in the area and serves as a quiet and peaceful escape from the bustle of King St.Also in SOMA, drop by Ritch Street during a week day around noon. On one end, there\'s Cafe Cento. They brew blue bottle and I recommend their Iced Cento drink. Next to Cento is Farmer Brown\'s Little Skillet and people tend to like their chicken & waffles, but I prefer the grits and sausage. Enjoy your southern comfort food and blue bottle in the sun while sitting on the ledge outside. On the other end of Ritch Street there\'s a high-quality cafe called Cafe Darwin. Everything on their menu is fresh, local, organic, prepared with attention to detail and downright delicious. They have a thing for French cuisine. I guess you could call it "Frenchfranciscan"! If you\'re feeling "healthy", grab one of their famous kale salads. If you\'re feeling cold from the fog, grab a cappuccino and a nutella-mascarpone baguette. Get legitimate off-the-beaten-path Asian food on Clement Street. Burmese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Cantonese - it\'s all there. Also drop by Green Apple Books (check out their Used Book annex if you want to save money and buy a book in top condition) and lose yourself in a book while enjoying bubble tea.Mojo Bicycle Cafe! If you are by Alamo Square Park, be sure to drop by Mojo Bicycle Cafe, an incredibly cute coffee bicycle shop that really comes to life after 5pm. The neighborhood comes here for beer, sangria, and great conversation in the evening. Corona Heights! A pretty hill with a gorgeous vista that doesn\'t get many visitors outside of dog owners chilling in the adjacent doggy park. I recommend walking down Masonic Ave to get there and enjoying the beautiful mansions along the way. I love this park, it\'s surrounded by a lovely stair-cased part of town filled with cherry blossoms. Anthony\'s Cookies on 25th and Valencia!

They have lots of low tables too!NOT looking to break the bank? Oh. Well, then, I can\'t help you. I\'m a designer. (Just kidding!)My next choice would probably be to have some cushions made. If you\'d like to explore this option, start by heading down to Britex Fabrics, a fascinating destination unto itself with a wonderful array of fabrics in every color and style imaginable. Then go down to Cushion Works and have them manufacture your floor cushions in a variety of interesting shapes and sizes suitable for your space. Depending on how handy you are with a sewing machine, you might need a good upholstery person to put these two elements together for you. I suggest Louis Custom Upholstery in the Mission.What\'s that you say?? Custom not in your budget either? Le sigh. You really do try a designer\'s patience, sir.Okay, affordable retail: HD Buttercup over on Townsend usually has some interesting floor cushions. West Elm has some fun little floor "poufs" that might be of interest. World Market and Target are probably good (look online and see what you think). For one-of-a-kind, handmade items, Etsy is always a great choice.

My office is several stones\' throws away from Moffett Field, where the Endeavour was scheduled to fly by, so many of us decided to walk over to the Steven\'s Creek trail where we\'d have a prime viewing location. When we got there at 9:45 AM, there was already a large group of viewers waiting on the trail: people who brought their kids, people who had just biked in from home, and people like me who walked over from work. People were lining the trail, some armed with DSLR cameras and some with iPhone cameras.(this second photo reminds me a bit of Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grande Jatte)The shuttle had been scheduled to fly over sometime between 9 and 10 AM, but we had received updates that said it was going to be more like 10:15. While we waited, I made a message out of the rocks scattered on the trail to occupy the time.At 10:36 AM, I heard "there it is!" Of course, this meant nothing since we had been jokingly saying that about several commercial airliners we saw in the distance while we were waiting. But after hearing the words a few more times, followed by the phrase "for real," I looked off into the distance and saw a faint silhouetted splotch of gray in the sky. And though a splotch it may have been, I was sure that this splotch was the splotch we were waiting for.Camera turned on? Check. Camera lens off? Check. You\'ve only got one shot at this, because it literally is not happening again for the forseeable future.

So many of us in the parking lot, a few kids and some dogs and mostly retirees, including people who\'d worked on the shuttle. I remember being high school age and watching the footage of the Challenger disaster with a sick feeling in my gut.

That was amazing. I watched one or two take-offs while I was in Florida...and I was in the Mojave for Burt Rutan\'s crew capturing the Ansari Prize.This is the first one I got to share with my kids. I choked up at the thought of this being the last flight of any Space Shuttle, and what that means as a passage of time. We peered at the sky while we waited, KNX newsradio on the air courtesy of someone\'s car (oh, how Southern California), speculating on the direction it would be coming from, scanning the skies and jumping at anything airborne in the blue. "No, that\'s just Southwest\'s shuttle, out of Burbank."It finally came from the east, and was lost in the trees...but wait, wait, there it came, heading south RIGHT TOWARD US!!!I managed to snap a few shots, but having it go directly overhead was a thrill I hadn\'t expected.

The Paradise Tree Snake or Paradise Flying Snake (Chrysopelea paradisi) is found in Asia andit can, like all species of its genus Chrysopelea, glide by stretching the body into a flattened strip using its ribs. It is mostly found in moist forests and can cover a horizontal distance of about 100 metres in a glide from the top of a tree. Slow motion photography shows an undulation of the snake\'s body in flight while the head remains relatively stable, suggesting controlled flight. They are mildly venomous with rear fangs and also can constrict its prey mostly lizards and bats.[1]Once at a height the snake deems suitable, he/she climbs out on to the horizontal limbs. In preparation for the flight, the snake then slips the upper half of its body off the branch, dangling in a j shape. The serpent then leaps into the air, using the powerful muscles in the lower half of its body. Upon lift off, the snake snake stretches out its ribs, instantly flattening the body and taking on an s shape. This action also causes the belly region of the snake to take on a concave shape that acts as a parachute. The snakes plan is to merely enlarge its surface area and increase air resistance, thus slowing its descent. During this period of flattening, the body expands to nearly double normal width. While aloft, the snake undulates and the body contorts to catch air drafts and glide. While the undulations help propel the snake, their true propose is to control the snakes direction. C. paradisi is unique among the flying snake species by the method it uses to change direction. Most species simply bank in the direction they wish to go. C. paradisi on the other hand, turns by moving the anterior portion of the snakes body.[2] Most snakes are excellent swimmers even rattlesnakes.[3,4] They are "cold-blooded (poikilothermic) and control their temperature by behaviour."[5] They\'re known to bask in the sun to warm up or seek shade or water to cool themselves. In the case of a sea snake (a great swimmer), "its thermal tolerance limit of 36.0 \xc2\xb1 0.3\xc2\xbaC and 11.7 \xc2\xb1 0.2\xc2\xbaC."[6] "The seasonal range of water temperature in the bay is from about 8 \xc2\xb0C (46 \xc2\xb0F) to about 23 \xc2\xb0C (73 \xc2\xb0F)."[7] So, unless it\'s in the dead of winter and assuming the snake hasn\'t sustained any trauma from the fall (see Chrysopelea paradisi above), it would more than likely swim the short distance to shore and avoiding death by freezing.[8,9][1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr...[2] http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s...[3] http://www.californiaherps.com/b...[4] http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~tit...[5] http://www.wildlifetasmania.com/...[6] http://www.stri.si.edu/sites/pub...[7] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San...[8] http://www.fws.gov/home/feature/...[9] http://www.vpi.com/sites/default...Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 3, 'answer_user': 'Roderick Chow'}, {'answer': 'There is a good possibility that a snake would survive the fall, but the cold water would sap its body heat pretty quickly and it would probably die before reaching shore.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 5, 'answer_user': 'Andrew Gutsch'}, {'answer': 'Yes, the water in the bay is very cold.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Philip Green'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2011, 12, 7, 10, 4), 'tag': ['Falling', 'Animal Physiology', 'Animal Welfare', 'Golden Gate Bridge', 'Snakes', 'San Francisco Bay Area', 'Hypothetical Questions', 'Science', 'Physics'], 'question_user': 'David Urquhart'}

On the other hand, the fine for not having enough cash to pay your toll is something like $30.So perhaps you should weigh the hassle of having to remember to find an ATM in the East Bay against paying nothing (or even getting paid) to take home a FasTrak device the next time you find yourself at a Walgreens or a Costco.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 4, 'answer_user': 'Ben Newman'}, {'answer': "The FasTrak is free.

In 1965, advancing corrosion sparked a program to remove the original lead-based paint (which was 68% red lead paste in a linseed oil carrier). The removal continued to 1995. In 1965, the original paint was replaced with an inorganic zinc silicate primer and acrylic emulsion topcoat. In the 1980s, this paint system was replaced by a water-borne inorganic zinc primer and an acrylic topcoat.

The density of steel is 7850 kg/m3. That comes out to 1273 cubic meters of solid steel.

The right option depends on the time of day. Use Google Maps to get you there.If you're a tourist, though, I think that's a pretty boring way to go.

If you're feeling mildly adventurous, you can take the bike over the bridge and down to Sausalito or Tiburon and catch a ferry back to Fisherman's Wharf from there.If you are a transit nerd, this lets you get 5 modes in on one trip!

Afterwards you can either continue on towards the beach/Cliff House or walk to the Legion of Honor (wonderful museum and the site of a pivotal scene from Hitchcock's Vertigo). Also check out Sutro Baths. - Take the ferry to Angel Island and visit the Immigration Station where you can see many of the poems carved into the wall by immigrants who were housed there for days/months. Also a great place of hiking and picnicking.- Climb the Moraga Steps and enjoy a fantastic and WINDY view of the city. Afterwards explore the various restaurants in the Sunset and if you're feeling up for it, walk/run/bike to the beach.- Visit one of the many museums in the city on a Free Day (Free Museum Day San Francisco\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 )- Golden Gate Park of course! The de Young Museum has a free day but their observation tower is always free. The Music Concourse is a great spot for people watching or reading. The Japanese Tea Garden requires an admission fee but I don't think it's that much.- Go see a movie at the Castro Theater. They have fantastic sing-a-longs to musicals, as well as double features. (Castro Theatre - Calendar of Events)- Get ice cream from Bi-Rite and enjoy it in Dolores Park. - You can be tourist-y and get dim sum in Chinatown, but I suggest heading out to the Richmond District (Hong Kong Lounge on Geary is great) or even out to the Peninsula.-Explore Berkeley and Oakland. - If you can, make a trip out to the South Bay and get Korean BBQ. - Free events happening around SF/the Bay Area are always available on Funcheap SF (FunCheap.com)Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 2, 'answer_user': 'Cynthia Yee'}], 'datetime': datetime.datetime(2014, 3, 13, 14, 40), 'tag': ['Restaurants in San Francisco', 'Backpacking (travel)', 'Tourism', 'San Francisco Bay Area', 'San Francisco', 'Food'], 'question_user': 'Michelle Thorp'}

A beautiful layout, and some really nice teas.As for Samovar\xe2\x80\x94here\'s my unbiased .02:We are not the cheapest. And we are most definitely not the most expensive. The thing to look for is COST PER GRAM. Don\'t look at the price tag of any tea\xe2\x80\x94because tea comes in a variety of package sizes.My goal with the company was to get artisan, whole leaf to out to the public in as approachable way as possible. That means unique, delicious, easy to brew tea that comes farm direct, is fresh, and offers value\xe2\x80\x94i.e., many infusions per leaf, as well as a complex and unique aroma and flavor profile. I\'m not into selecting artificially flavored teas (without naming names, some of the big national tea-chains are more focused on flavors like vanilla, chocolate and coconut than quality leaf). Any tea we "flavor" is flavor only with the actual raw herbal ingredients\xe2\x80\x94jasmine flowers, real bergamot fruit for earl grey, lychee fruit, blood orange rind, etc. Flavors are ok by me\xe2\x80\x94as long as they are not synthetic. Still overall I go for teas that have enough body, aroma and complex taste that create a unique and enjoyable experience\xe2\x80\x94and that have a great flavor without any additions. We specialize in premium Japanese teas, a few very select puerhs, some really beautiful Taiwanese oolongs, and overall just brews that you cannot find anywhere else. We are the only provider of "American tea" from the Big Island of Hawaii where we buy their entire season\'s yield because customers here appreciate it (although we are currently out of stock we expect some in before December 2011). Or, like another new arrival Purple Tea, from Kenya. Just arrived yesterday and supposedly really unique.

This applies to restaurants for these cuisines. French is a great example as others have pointed out.In a French multi-course formal dinner, cheese would come after the entrees but before the desserts and/or coffee. The more fancy the restaurant, the bigger and more exclusive the selection of cheese you can choose from. The top end will have "cheese carts" with Paul Bocuse offering ~40 different cheeses IIRC.In that format, you\'d have wine with the cheese. This could be what\'s left from the bottle from the entree or it could be wine-pairing specific to a cheese type (e.g. Sauternes for Roquefort). Note that a great restaurant may accommodate patrons that don\'t like cheese with a substitute. For example, Charlie Trotter\'s brought one of us a really nice fruit plate once the waiter realized my friend was toying with the cheese rather than eating it. On the other hand, if it\'s a truly long multi-course meal with a fixed price, you might simply end up skipping cheese since there\'s already so much food.Nowadays, many high-end restaurants will cut one course and instead offer patrons the choice of either the dessert or the cheese.

We\'re more into expensive, sugary pastries.1)*Valencia Pizza Pasta - 19th & valencia. A little mom and pop place with\xc2\xa0 A HUGE breakfast plate ($4) of two eggs (always seemed like more than two eggs to me though), hashbrowns & toast, and a fresh banana or orange that they don\'t include listed on the menu, but sneak onto your table anyway as if to say "I know you\'re hungover and you need your protein, but atleast try and get some healthy fruit in there!". These guys are utter sweethearts and they have a variety of hearty dinner/lunch things (that I have never eaten) for cheap and in large portions ($7-$13). Usually when I eat breakfast here, I don\'t need to eat till 10pm.2) Four Barrel Coffee at (14-15th and valencia) - Yeah, it\'s $4 for a mocha. It\'s the best mocha you\'ve ever tasted. But I\'m saying just get the drip ($2). It\'ll change the way you think about coffee, it\'s so DAMN good. I\'m not a foodie and I smoke a pack a day, so my palate isn\'t exactly sensitive and even I can tell that coffee is amazing! Starbucks\' $2 equivalent can SUCK IT. Other coffee places this fancy (and ahem, even less fancy) have drips up to $7 (A CUP!) or have "fair trade, environmental" nonsense everywhere and taste like, well, ass.3) Dynamo Donuts (24th and Hampshire) Super unique, awesome donuts ($2-$3.50) (maple bacon is just the beginning - lemon sichuan! etc!) Go inside to see how donuts are made. They also serve Four Barrel coffee (win!)4)*Grocery Store (24th & valencia) Get the fresh squeezed OJ. It\'s the best OJ EVER. You can watch them do it. I don\'t even like OJ and I swear by the stuff. Best start to your day! You can also get a bunch of bagels and cream cheese for less than $5, but only if you have a fridge to put it in. It\'s organic, environmentally friendly, family owned and still cheap. AMAZING!5) Mexican groceries! These are everywhere and\xc2\xa0 the fruit is really cheap (blueberries for $1 etc). Haight st market near Haight/Ashbury is good too.6)La Victoria Bakery (24th & Alabama) gives out free bagels monday mornings (freshly made)\xc2\xa0 and I think they do other free giveaways because they sometimes just come in to give us free, freshly baked, still warm bread! (I work nearby).http://missionlocal.org/2011/01/...DINNER/LUNCH1) Yamo at 18th & valencia. Amazing burmese food, nothing over $62) *Basa Seafood Express. at 24th & Treat. Huge HUGE plate of the best fish and chips (~$7, def for two people) I\'ve ever ever had and their fish sandwich (HUGE), I heard, is awesome ($5). Great (not best, but above average) clam chowder for $3.50. FRESH AND DELICIOUS and a hidden gem! Made to order.3) *Taqueria Vallarta at 24th & treat: beloved tacos ($1.75 each), but I love their veggie burrito ($5.15 tax included, best for two people!). Also see: Taqueria cancun (19th & mission, best veggie burrito in the city, cash only) & El Farolito (busy one at 24th & mission and then a less busy, locals one at 24th & Alabama one! SNEAKY!) (get the super suiza here ($6), sharing with two people HIGHLY RECOMMENDED unless you want to die of a food coma, cash only).4) Tulan at 6th and Market (down 6th). This neighborhood is going to suck. BUT DAMN this is delicious Vietnamese food (I wanna say ~$6) and meals are best shared with two or three people.5) Udupi Palace (21st and Valencia). There is a amazing samosa chat ($5) that brings me to tears how delicious it is. Admittedly, this is an appetizer but it fills me up.6) *Mission Chinese (18th and mission) okay, these guys are $11-$13 but they were called by the NYtimes as one of the top 3 hottest destinations in the country and you haven\'t eaten anything else like it. The wait can be a couple hours though, so get there early if you are prone to getting hangry (hungry+angry).7) *Rhea\'s Deli (19th & valencia) ($7-$10) People freak out about these sandwiches (and rightly so), they are phenomenal. The veggie BBQ sandwich is vegan, but they\'re more known for their pork sandwiches. The owner is a sweetheart and they have cute people working there. On a nice day, go to dolores park and eat it (18th and dolores) for cute dogs and if youre lucky, more cute people!BOOZE/CIGS1)\xef\xbb\xbfThe Phonebooth (25th and south van ness) has $4.00 basic drinks (e.g whiskey/ginger) that is huge and a couple of these will easily get you drunk (One is enough for me but I am 5\'2 and less than 100lbs). Strongest, cheapest drinks in town and subsequently, very chatty, friendly clientle. This isn\'t no happy hour thing, but actual prices!

{'qid': 1147, 'ans_num': 53, 'question': '\xe2\x98\x85What are the best brunch places in San Francisco?', 'answers': [{'answer': 'Littler Places* Magic Flute (Sacramento, near Spruce) is arguably my favorite, and simply a beautiful place for brunch. The food is spot on, even exquisite, and the whole spread for brunch is well appointed.\xc2\xa0 The atmosphere (especially in the back garden) is more leisurely and peaceful than at Mama\'s or Dottie\'s, and they take reservations.Zazie (Cole, at Carl) has the most amazing eggs benedict (and variations), yet the roasted potatoes and garlic that come with are mindblowing enough that they manage to hold their own (and I don\'t even like roasted potatoes that much...usually). They have long lines, but you can hide out at the bar next door and they\'ll come call you.Slow Club (Mariposa, at Hampshire) is amazing, with deliciously tasty, surprisingly affordable food, a smallish but open and bright dining room, and friendly staff. It\'s neither too quiet nor too loud. The area (in the fuzzy corridor between Mission and Potrero Hill) is not as busy, making parking easy on weekend mornings. They take reservations! Absolutely a favorite.Outerlands (Judah, at 45th) has amazing, exquisite food. In a delightful, beautiful, easygoing space. The only downside is that they are a little far. But they make up for this by being near the ocean (frigid as it is in San Francisco)!Blue Bottle (Mint Plaza, Mint at Jessie) is a great place for a light brunch (poached eggs on toast, waffles, french toast, granola, etc.) on the weekends. You don\'t get to sit down at a table here, so for a long time this was consigned to the "others" list. But it\'s so good and so cozy (and they have the paper) and so surprisingly easy seating-wise that I can\'t resist any longer.Wider PlacesMama\'s (Stockton, at Filbert) is worth the wait. If you\'re open to going anytime, then breakfast on weekdays is a great way to get your Mama\'s fix without the standard line.Dottie\'s True Blue Cafe (Jones, at O\'Farrell) serves hearty, comfort brunch food similar to Mama\'s, also in a crowded corner joint and accompanied by a line of hungry devotees.\xc2\xa0 The decor is slightly more diner and less bright-and-airy than Mama\'s, but the food is still delicious. It\'s also conveniently close to Union Square.\xc2\xa0 Their pancakes are great.Top of the Mark (California, at Mason; in the Mark Hopkins hotel) serves possibly the best brunch buffet in the city, against panel after glass panel of gorgeous city views.\xc2\xa0 The layout is definitely on the luxurious side, including champagne and caviar, and there is no attendant tradeoff in variety; it\'s\xc2\xa0 certainly worth the not inexpensive price. Certainly a place where you should plan on devoting a few hours of your Sunday if you go.Foreign Cinema (Mission, between 21st & 22nd) serves great, if not the most spectacular, brunch, and my personal opinion is that the brightness of the courtyard and surrounding corridors (for indoor seating) counts for a lot. The bacon is delicious, and the rest of the menu thoughtfully done.Mission Beach Cafe (14th, at Guerrero) \xe2\x80\x94 biscuits and gravy to die for, but with luck you won\'t, because the rest of the brunch is tasty as well. The place is small so expect a wait.Brenda\'s French Soul Food (Polk, at Eddy) has great, hearty brunch food and awesome awesome biscuits. Lines are long on the weekends, and the biscuits are so good but so filling \xe2\x80\x94 a good solution is to stop by for a few biscuits to go on the weekend and come back for breakfast on a weekday morning.Also,Park Chow (9th, at Lincoln). Super nice for getting lunch within walking distance of the park.Chez Maman (18th, at Connecticut).Caffe Delucchi (the jutting corner of Columbus and Stockton), though I think I prefer this place for lunch.\xc2\xa0 Either way, it\'s a great to while away a few hours at one of their sidewalk tables.Toast Eatery (Church, at Day); not mindblowing, but good and cozy, tucked on a little Noe Valley corner, with a handful of sidewalk tables out front.Bushi tei Bistro (Post, at Laguna); simple and light brunch, with slightly less traditional offerings.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the best meal that Bushi tei serves, though dinner is decent.Cliff House Bistro (1090 Point Lobos Avenue) has lovely brunch in a beautiful bright room over the ocean.\xc2\xa0 The food is fantastic.*On augmenting my original list with places I\'ve tried and come to love in the last nearly-two years, I\'m also dividing this into littler and wider places. This is an entirely made-up metric based solely on how the place "feels" to me.Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...', 'upvote': 36, 'answer_user': 'Jessica Hui'}, {'answer': "The question specifically asked for best brunch places, not popular (per the Answer Wiki). So to make my Very Short List of the Absolute Best Brunch Places in San Francisco, these places must meet the following criteria:1. Not a crazy wait, or at least there are known time periods with an acceptable wait. Usually I expect to wait less than half an hour to be seated. I value my time more highly than some 7x7 writer's opinion.2. Truly memorable food in the competitive San Francisco food scene. Boogaloos has no place on this list. It's a fun place to go when you have a hangover and want to stuff your face with grease, occasionally peering out the window for a little sunshine. It does not serve gourmet food.So without further ado, here are the brunch places most deserving of a visit:Plow in Potrero Hill. The newest contender on this list (opened in 2010) and already possibly the king of San Francisco brunch. As Mary Ray has said: lemon ricotta pancakes. Get there as early as you can. Mission Beach Cafe in the Mission. The absolute best eggs benedict that I have ever had, better than Zazie's for sure. The clientele skews get-up-late (and hipster glasses) here, so you could go before 10:30 am or 11 am and possibly not encounter a daunting wait. Everything on the menu is just better than most versions you've had before.Tartine Bakery, but only after 8:30 am on weekday mornings! Because the wait is insane with tourists on weekends and on early weekday mornings with Noe Valley jogger moms. The pastries are crumb-licking fantastic. Especially the croissant (all variations -- Niman Ranch ham & cheese, double pain au chocolate, plain butter), the tea cakes, the fruit scones, the bread pudding, and...just everything.Serpentine (Dogpatch/Potrero) and Slow Club (Mission). Very good ratio of high-quality food to almost-nonexistent wait. Just For You is near Serpentine and is well-loved for some reason that I could never understand.

In my experience, restaurant owners will attend mixers that chambers host 1-2 times a month. You can also ask the chamber for an intro/referral. Explain to them what you're doing. They should be happy to make the introduction.Finally, call up the restaurants and ask when the next time the owner will be in. Assuming it's not during a peak time, go to the restaurant in person and explain to them that you need their feedback for a product you are designing for them. Bring any prototypes/screen shots you have, preferably on an iPad.Two things to keep in mind:1. Owners can be hard to get a hold of. Often, a manager will have just as much experience and can answer the questions just as well. They may not be the decision maker, but for customer development, there are usually a couple different people you can speak with that can answer the questions you have. Building a relationship with them is also key when you return to sell something to the owner. They have the potential to be a huge asset to you.2. Remember - most people like to share their opinions. Don't be shy about asking people for theirs. If they feel you're genuine and have the opportunity to help shape a product that will help them, most should be happy to give you all the feedback you need. Approach them with that in mind.Good luck!Embed QuoteSuggest EditsLoading...", 'upvote': 1, 'answer_user': 'Emil Gallardo'}, {'answer': "Call them and offer them something they want as part of talking to you.
